He is frequently absent to nonexistent on the student forum Piazza, and many questions are left unanswered or answered only affer they aren’t relevant anymore (i.e. exam/project questions after the deadline). A couple examples:\r\n\r\n1. For our midterm we were learning stuff up to the week before the exam. Porter confirmed that the exam material may include what was taught in lecture that week, but neglected to upload the slides for that material. Many students asked on the forum for the slides, frequently (13 hours before the exam, 9 hours, then 5 and then 2 hours before the exam, all on the same thread). One hour before the exam the professor finally responds saying “Sorry for the missing slides” but still neglects to upload them\r\n\r\n2. On the Tuesday a week before Thanksgiving break Porter assigned us another lab, to be due the following Monday (2 days before break). Again, students posted on the forum asking for an extension on the lab due date as many people were traveling for break and as the lab was also longer and more difficult than any other. Once again, no response from the professor, even after over 30 people “good questioned” it on Piazza. The day after, he assigned another lab due the Monday after break.\r\n\r\n3. The semester project was not brought up again until midterm season, and he waited an extra week to release the project idea bds, and then ANOTHER week to release the project signups (this wasn’t intentional, he released them late), which left us about a month to start and finish a priject from scratch in addition to the weekly labs and our other classes.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, this class was a huge disappointment and made me reconsider never doing Android dev ever again. Other reviews say Porter grows bitter as more and more students stop going to class, but he also grows really unresponsive and irresponsible. He doesn’t do a good job teaching; he just reads off the slides, which by themselves are just screenshots of sample code. Most of our labs we finished with a mix of stack overflow and just copying the sample code.', 'rating': 1, 'expected_grade': 'A', 'created': '2018-11-21T01:56:02Z'}, {'professor': 'Adam Porter', 'course': 'CMSC436', 'review': 'Totally ineffective as a lecturer. He reads from the slides that are literally just text and bullet points. Lecturers are not engaging, and because the emulator on android studio is laggy and takes forever, he cannot demonstrate how apps work but instead shows you the code in fragments on his slide which are of no help.\r\n\r\nHis labs are relatively easy because they are ""fill in the blank"" style. These weekly labs were slightly annoying because they did not offer anything substantial to teach you. You could easily look up how to do something on stack overflow and it was normally a one liner. But I guess it is harder to make normal cs projects that involve making an application on android from scratch so personally I do not know what other alternative there could be.\r\n\r\nNow about the big group project: I feel this was managed horribly. The teams were not assigned until after the first midterm in mid October along with the potential project ideas to pick from if you didn\'t have an original one of your own. This left students 6 weeks to build an android application from scratch, while balancing weekly labs and other coursework. 6 weeks was not an adequate time frame to do a group project. You are normally a team of 6 people but thats still hard to manage during the roughest part of the semester.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to the midterm, students felt they got steam rolled. It was all short answer with a few true/false mixed in. the average was around a 64%. Fortunately the labs and the group project will weigh more than exams in the long run. Several students who took the midterm felt railroaded but that is partially due to Porters ineffective teaching.\r\n\r\nI learned the most about android dev doing my own outside research on youtube and stack overflow and most importantly during the group project. That is where the real learning starts. I understand this class will be switching over to iOS development for handhelds but whether or not that is a permanent thing or if it will alternate from fall to spring semester from android to iOS i am not sure. If Porter is teaching 436 again don\'t worry. The class is not too hard and its pretty manageable to get a high passing grade. Just don\'t expect much from Porter.

The class was not difficult but TA's/professors were not very responsive in Piazza and Porter gave off a vibe that he did not really care about the class that much. My biggest gripe is with the midterm and final, where no practice material or quizzes were given beforehand, and we were not given the midterm back. The class was not hard but throughout the semester it was unclear what my grade in the class was as the weekly labs were only worth 25% of my grade, and the average for the first midterm was 65%, which indicates the class should be curved (Although Porter never talked about us or assured that a curve would happen). I went into the final not knowing what 50% of my grade in the class was going to be due to the final project being graded, and a week after the final I am still unsure what my final grade is.

Assignments - In Fall 2021 we had 6 assignments (2 written, 4 programming). While they are somewhat helpful in understanding the material, their length makes them really time consuming (more than expected for a 400 level class). For example, I remember writing 20 or so SQL queries where 10 would have been perfectly sufficient, and in general the written assignments were really long. They aren\'t necessarily difficult, but you definitely have to start early. One nice thing that I really appreciated was that Amol gives you 10 free late days (up to 5 on a single assignment). \r\n\r\n2. Exams - The exams are quite difficult, not in terms of content but more so in terms of time. If you had 24 hours to complete it, you could probably get 80+ assuming you understood the material. But with the time constraint, it was definitely very hard to complete all of the questions fully (the averages on the exam were around 60%). One good thing is that Amol puts a fat curve on the class. He didn\'t disclose the official cutoffs, but in the beginning of the semester he said that an 80% would be an A (i think it ended up being a few points lower). \r\n\r\n3. Content - This is probably my biggest gripe with the class. Amol tries to cover at least 2 semesters worth of content in this class. As a result, he moves extremely fast and tends to not explain things as fully as he can. For in depth explanations, he just tells you to read the textbook (which is decent). The content starts off at a decent pace, but after midterm 1 really picks up. I didn\'t feel like I was able to absorb anything meaningful because I was so focused on just cramming all of this information into my head to study. I also think that a lot of the content can be changed. We spend a lot of time learning about specific operations on disk, even though Amol prefaces the unit saying ""no systems actually do it this way anymore."" He justifies it saying that this is still the foundation, but I personally found it very discouraging. \r\n\r\n4. Campuswire - This is maybe more of a personal issue, but Amol insists on using campuswire instead of piazza. I really hate campuswire (and I think the majority of the class did too). I find it harder to search posts, and you can\'t follow questions for when they\'ve been answered.\r\n\r\nIn general, databases is a pretty dry subject so I don\'t blame Amol for the class being generally boring. One thing I really liked was that he was very responsive so you generally got a fast response to questions on campuswire. He did also listen to students\' COVID concerns and had exams online (along with recorded lecture). There\'s definitely improvements to be made, so unless you are very interested in databases or need the class for a major requirement, I would avoid this class for now. \r\n', 'rating': 2, 'expected_grade': 'A+', 'created': '2021-12-24T23:56:34Z'}, {'professor': 'Amol Deshpande', 'course': 'CMSC424', 'review': ""He gets a lot of hate but I don't fully understand why.

He would just plow through his slides which were pretty much just copy and paste from the textbook, but he wouldn't explain the content on the slides well. He would pretty much just end up reading it straight from the slides and then assume that we know exactly what it means, while on most slides there was always something he could explain more. This made the class really difficult when it came to exam time. There could be a question that was somewhat similar to the slides, and many students would still have no clue how to do it, which is a big issue. When you go to office hours, there have been multiple times where I've asked the different TAs the same question and have gotten a different answer, which made things even harder to understand.\r\n\r\nThe assignments were actually not too hard, just takes a lot of time, so you really have to set time to really work on it.

Instead of paying attention during class I would just go through Dr. Spring's lecture file and if I was going at the same pace as him I could ask questions. Otherwise I would just figure things out by myself. It was nice that he allowed laptops during lecture. If you want to keep up with Spring during lecture you either have to be a genius, already know C really well, or study the lecture slides the night before (Note: Spring doesn't use lecture slides, but we had access to Nelson's lecture slides.) \n\r\nDiscussion:\r\nWas somewhat useful I guess. We had about five quizzes and two unannounced graded lab projects. The quizzes and lab projects were fairly easy. If we didn't have a project or quiz the TA would go over something useful for the current project. \n\r\nProjects:\r\nRange of difficulty on the projects. We had six projects and the most difficult one was probably the Shell project (#5 for my class). I was lazy about testing and would fail a couple of secret tests on the projects. The secret tests are much more in depth than they were in CMSC132. \n\r\nAssembly:\r\nThis class is on C and Assembly. I thought Assembly was fun and not that hard. If you are one of those people that rely on compilation and debugging to see if your code works you are going to have a hard time with assembly. My advice is just to go slow and keep very careful track of the registers. Debugging in Assembly is very hard, so your goal is to not have to debug. For our assembly project I wrote 2/3 files perfectly on the first try because I was VERY careful and coded very slowly. \n\r\nTests:\r\nThe first exam and the final were very hard multiple-multiple choice questions (like circle all correct answers, not just circle one letter). I think they made the 2nd and 3rd exam a little easier to account for the fact that the average on the first exam was like a 60%. They liked to make you code parts of the project on the exams to make sure you knew what you were doing on the project and that you weren't just guessing on the project. \n\r\nLast Remarks:\r\nI didn't treat this class with enough respect, which is why I got an A-.

I hated it. Every word that came out of his mouth filled me with aggravation and contempt. I thought he was an egotistical, straight edged jerk not to mention being completely boring and seemingly condescending to students. I was dreading the previous semester knowing that he was the only teacher for CMSC 216.\n\r\n As every other reviewer has mentioned he does in fact take attendance, force people to sit in the front, prohibit electronic devices during lecture, etc. He will also ask the trickiest, exception-to-the-rule questions on tests that are generally the difference between an A and a B. \n\r\nSome of the projects can also take a pretty good amount of time and probably average to about 20 hours or so but can be done in a lot less time with good planning/understanding. However, if you don’t know what you’re doing, he tends to not include some of the key details on his slides so you will not be able to get a lot of the practical information unless you are regularly attending lecture even though he says that the “lecture notes will be posted on line so you don’t need to take notes” which most students mistakenly interpret as “you don’t need to come to class”. \n\r\nYet as the semester went on I slowly came to the realization that he was actually doing almost all of these things to the benefit of the students. \n\r\nAs was noted in a reviewer below me noted, the no-electronic policy forces you to pay attention with the exception of an occasional text. \n\r\nPreventing students from sitting in the back gets them closer to the material and allows him to police for devices better. \n\r\nHis stringency on the honesty policy is annoying on face value, but definitely one of the most annoying things are when people who have no understanding of material get credit for things other people came up with, so his strictness could be out of respect for the students that are actually doing their own work. \n\r\nHis attendance taking is also not in the grading policy, so lack of attendance will not directly affect your grade. He claims to use it simply as a statistical study on the grades earned versus attendance, but I also suspect that he uses it for curving. For example, he will be much more likely to curve up a grade from a B+ to at least and A- if he sees that they have attended almost every lecture. \n\r\nAlmost any time a good portion of the class is in jeopardy of missing the project deadline, he will extend it even though if the whole class wouldn’t have been remiss in their responsibilities as students and started even a few days earlier they would have been fine. He always assigns them with ample time in the first place. Ample.\n\r\nAlso, early in the semester I discovered that I had a scheduling conflict with the final exam and he said that it wasn’t a problem and let me take it with three other people at a later date. \n\r\nI also missed a quiz and hadn’t notified him or the TA until the day of and he still allowed the zero to be replaced with the average of my other quiz grades.\n\r\nConcerning the lecture material, he is good. He is always well prepared and he always drills the important parts that you need to remember. Always. Drills. Knowing these drilled points should secure you a B in the class. \n\r\nTo achieve an A in the class, Larry expects a mastery of the subject material. He expects an A to signify Excellence, unlike other classes where A stands for Average and anything below that stands for Stupid.\n\r\nTherefore, Larry is a great teacher. Anyone who argues otherwise is either too stupid to get the grade they want, or too arrogant to put in the work he requires.

The spec for each one is drawn out and boring to read, but make sure you do, as there are a lot of hidden tricks and requirements hidden in the text. Gone are the days of private tests - 10 percent of your grade is public tests, and 75 is secret tests. You don't get to see what your project grade is when you submit - you wait a week and you get a magic score. Again, start these early. If you finish early, great, you can relax for a week and you are prepared for the quizzes. Again, this is NOT like 132. Secret tests often test a bunch of odd things (malformed input, large sample size, etc) and since you can't see the results until it is graded you can't just spam submits like in 132 until you get that perfect submission.\n\r\nQuizzes are slightly tough. If you haven't started the project most likely the material on the quiz will be brand new to you, and considering you are given 15 minutes to do a few concept questions and a programming assignment, you need to know the subject matter going into the quiz.\n\r\nLabs are the same as quizzes - if you have started the project, you should know what you are doing because the labs are a derivative of the project material of stuff that has gone on in lecture.\n\r\nTests are fairly hard, alot of programming questions, and the graders seem to love taking points off on things like syntax (I always found that rather stupid - a compiler will catch syntax errors, not logic errors).

(I didn't)\r\n-The entire course is in a Linux environment, through GRACE. If you're already familiar with Unix commands and such, you're in luck. Unfortunately I wasn't, and this made the first few weeks using it very, very confusing. Even at the end of the course I still felt weak with Unix.\r\n-You use Emacs to code in which is OK. The debugger is complicated and I never bothered leaning how to use it. I just debugged using print statements and other little tricks.\r\n-The major topics for the course were as follows: Learning basic C, Arrays in C, Structures, Pointers and pointer arithmetic, Makefiles, Dynamic Memory, Assembly, Process Control, Function pointers, Threads, and some misc.\r\n-Both Midterms and the Final were good. They were challenging but definitely not unreasonable and tested fair material.\r\n-The quizzes, on the other hand, were plain rude. The difficulty was unreasonable, they tested stupid material, they were graded harshly, and everyone failed the shit out of them. I failed every quiz except for 2.\r\n-Lab exercises were really hard for me, and I felt like everyone knew what they were doing except me. I would recommend trying to study the material that the lab is on beforehand. It's hard to ask questions when you're completely lost.\r\n-There were 6 projects, each of them took around 10-18 hrs to complete. Projects for this class were hard and stressful (a recurring theme). I didn't need office hours at all in 132 but I went for 4/6 projects for 216. The difficulty of the projects went up for each one. Even though the projects were extremely challenging, I thought they were all semi-reasonable as long as you started early. Except for the last one. \r\n-(Mini rant) The last fucking project. Assigned literally 10 days before the final, it was easily the hardest and longest project of the year. Project 6 stressed me out so much that I felt like I was going to vomit in the coming days before it was due. (Right before the final remember) You have to pass 75% of the public tests for each project to pass the course, and I couldn't pass any of them until the day before the project was due. I tried to go to office hours all 3 days before it was due, and each day office hours had at least a 20 person waiting-list for 1 TA. I have NO IDEA what Jan was thinking. How difficult was the project to complete? Fuck if I know, I didn't even try to implement threading because I needed to study for my two hardest finals that were the first day of finals week. \r\n-Overall the course was VERY fast paced. Looking back I definitely learned a ton from the course, but I didn't really have time to get a thorough understanding of all the topics.\n\r\nThis is the review of Jan:\r\n-I'm giving Jan 4 stars mainly because I think her current rating of 2 is too low. \r\n-Jan is a very nice person and a pretty good lecturer. She has a good grasp on all the material and knows what she's talking about. It's not too hard to pay attention in class, there is just so much material that it's easy to instantly forget a lot of it.\r\n-The format of the class is a bit boring. Powerpoint lectures.\r\n-Some of the powerpoints are not well done and confusing. You really need to pay attention in lecture to figure out what's going on. Especially the powerpoint on Assembly, which I thought explained Memory very poorly.\n\r\nAdvice:\r\n-Go to class, study before the Lab Exercises and quizzes.\r\n-Start the projects as early as you can. I wish I hadn't procrastinated some of them.\r\n-Make a couple friends and talk about the projects together.

Unlike Nelson, who will usually make his exams based around high-level understanding with code, a lot of Yoon\'s questions felt like tricks.

Suppose that A & B are correct but you put down A & C and, so the points gained and lost for that question equal out to zero, so it is like you never attempted the question. You have to be super confident to get points on these because any incorrect answers will lower your grade. Don’t even try to guess on these questions because you will just hurt your grade. If that wasn’t enough there is a question at the end which takes the longest, but also in a sense is a simple you get it or you don’t.

He essentially makes attending lectures mandatory because of the unannounced classwork. He is a stickler for the rules, like having KN95 mask instead of the generic blue mask (last semester when it was mandatory). He puts a password for all his attachments which is really inconvenient. His projects are probably the hardest among any other classes I have taken and the deadline is not generous (compared to other classes at least). His lectures are extremmmelllllyyyy boring. He essentially didn\'t curve at all last semester for like the first time because of ""over-performance."" He doesn\'t like being called a professor because of the technicalities of the word (lol). I could go on and on about him.\r\n\r\nBut when you take the other CS classes, you\'ll start to appreciate him. The biggest issue I have with the current CS classes I take is the inconsistencies in practice content and real exam content. The cheating that goes around doesn\'t make things any better. In this respect, Larry Herman is tough but fair. Occasionally, yes, you\'ll get a question that you would not know if you strictly did the practice exam, however, this was rare and often would not take you down too much in points. Also, the amount of time he gives for his exams is more than enough. For the final, it seemed like more than half of the people finished early and left.\r\n\r\nAlso, Larry rarely makes grading mistakes, at least not to the degree other professors do. For the current classes, I am taking, to put into perspective, I have to make a regrade request almost every single time. I only had to fix a mistake with him once. \r\n\r\nAdmittedly, as one of the reviewers here pointed out, I have learned programming outside of the class. And if I didn\'t have prior experience, I probably would not be as successful in this class, or at the least, I would have had to put more effort to achieve the same result. But honestly, if you genuinely have a passion for coding, that is the only way you can possibly succeed in this major for the average person. And if you have a genuine passion for something, you should have prior experience. And even if you are just here pursuing a CS major for the bank, you gotta admit, there is no CS lecturer fairer than Larry Herman. \r\n\r\nOf course, because I mentioned his flaws with him at the beginning, I had to take a star away. I wish he was a bit more lenient in many respects than I listed above; trust me, I\'m not happy that he did not curve grades at all when I took 132 with him. But when you advanced further into the CS major, you\'ll soon come to realize what a privilege it was to learn from a fair person and the things you complained about are minor inconveniences that even have some sense to it (for instance, he wants people to come to class so learning is more effective, hence unannounced classwork).

I don't personally take notes, but I don't think anyone could with how fast he goes. He still did a good job at explaining concepts and the slides were well made, so you could basically just study off of those. He was clearly frustrated this semester by the turnout in lecture. Clicker quizzes used to be 4% of the grade, basically making lecture attendance mandatory. They changed the policy in the first week of the semester I believe, since people could be in and out with COVID. He would make lots of comments to himself during lecture about how it's so hard to teach this semester with not that many people in lecture and with everyone wearing masks.

People tried to ask Mamat/Eastman to change it to in-person and they said they would think about, but they did nothing.

Even what material we were going to cover over the condensed course was questioned a lot by the instructors and TAs. At one point, they even outright lied (probably not intentionally) about what was going to be covered/not covered on the final exam. All of this had a direct impact on the class, and this run of CMSC330 had some of the lowest exam averages on record (the class was curved substantially to make up for this). Apparently, this was due to Cliff somehow not being told that the course was going to only be 6 weeks long instead of 12 weeks long, but I digress.\r\n\r\nAs a lecturer, Cliff was not the worst. He typed things out in Vim to demonstrate concepts, but he went fast and it was largely hit or miss if this approach beat out just sticking to dense slides. For instance, typing out code in Vim made sense, but once we got to NFAs/DFAs and grammars... Why not use whiteboarding software instead?

I think the previous poster didn't really understand the point of the projects (considering they stated how it was just locate the standard library function and do it in this way, because that wasn't the point). It was to help us to understand how protocols work, and in that sense, it was connected to the material in lecture. But the final project was the most important. It really showed how hard network programming is, because you have to account for so many things, so it's much harder than say, Operating Systems. The final project was meant to help us understand that every decision in networking has some sort of reason behind it. And it does have real world use. So that gives me the sense of accomplishment. It was meant to simulate a real-life project as well, as it took a lot of coding and testing, and you had to work with your group members. I had a group member who only wrote ~200 lines of code or so, but the reason I didn't say anything was because the fact is that we do have other classes, despite this being like a real-life job.\n\r\nI will agree that the lack of study material or review for exams was disappointing, but there is a reason for that. It's hard to make questions that students can solve in a reasonable amount of time that adequately test student knowledge, thus questions are reused. I'd just recommend studying the questions at the back of the book. It is a vast amount of information to cover, but that's how a lot of courses are.\n\r\nOne thing I do agree is that it would've been better to add a reading schedule. It would have helped a lot.\n\r\nOverall, I would say I learned a lot from this course. I learned that understanding networking means understanding communication in general. I learned that there is a reason for every decision in a RFC. The professor also taught us that what we needed to learn is how to learn, because this information will soon be obsolete, and that's something important for CS majors in general."", 'rating': 4, 'expected_grade': 'A-', 'created': '2016-01-05T19:42:00Z'}, {'professor': 'Ashok Agrawala', 'course': 'CMSC417', 'review': 'Agrawala was a horrible professor, and 417 was a horrible class.\n\r\nThis was possibly the worst computer science course I\'ve taken yet at this university.\n\r\nUnlike most other 400-level CS classes, that teach relevant and useful technology, this course seems to be mostly based on obsolete material. The projects don\'t convey any meaningful skills, and while in other classes I typically can look back on the projects and feel a sense of accomplishment, in this class, I felt like I jumped through hoops. (I got 100% or 90% on all the projects, so this isn\'t sour grapes -- the projects were just bad.\n\r\nFurther, the projects and lectures seemed entirely disconnected. I felt as if I was taking two different classes where two entirely different things were being taught. Lectures didn\'t prepare us for projects in any sense. As such, the projects weren\'t challenging, because they had to be easy enough for us to teach ourselves how to do. This meant that the projects consisted entirely of ""locate the standard library function to do this thing, and invoke it in the right way.""\n\r\nThe lectures were almost entirely taken from the textbook. If any reading had been assigned, this would mean that people who did the reading would get nothing out of lectures. The lectures were presented in an extremely dry and boring way. The lecturer would occasionally ask either extremely simple factual questions or incredibly complicated questions. Nobody was willing to venture an answer, because there was obviously a right answer (which the students didn\'t want to get wrong in front of the class), and in the simple case it seemed like the instructor was asking a trick question, while in the complicated case the students weren\'t sure of themselves. The instructor would, after doing this, chide the class for not participating. Further, the instructor would never revisit old or important material.\n\r\nThe exams were entirely disjoint from the lecture or projects. The two midterms focused almost entirely on concepts that appeared on one or two days of lecture. Further, the instructors refused to give students any information about what would be on the exam. This forced students to study huge amounts of information, including large parts of the textbook (which was tested on the exam, even though no readings had actually been assigned and there was no reading schedule for the course). Most students probably gave up; those that didn\'t were equally unprepared, because the exams were, rather than general, incredibly specific. The only way to get a good grade on the exam would have been to study in huge detail every aspect of the course. Typically, courses that require this have clear focus and direction, but this course had neither. It was like taking a survey of 1990\'s networking concepts and technology.\n\r\nOverall, taking this class was a vastly unpleasant experience.

I spent more time for this course than for most of the core 4 credit CS classes. A typical week would include about an hour of pre-recorded lectures, 2 quizzes on that content, 2 normal lecture hours, then either a MASSIVE project due over the weekend or several homework assignments. There were also 5 exams throughout the semester. Marsh said at the beginning that this courses bad wrap is due to it being ""one of the hardest the department offers"". I don\'t think the difficulty is the content, its entirely with how the course is organized. The lectures do not coincide with the projects, so for more than half the projects you\'ll be looking at text books learning the material to execute the projects. Marsh will release public test scripts to test your projects but they typically don\'t work, causing everyone stress by having to submit their project blindly. His testing scripts would also typically screw up on the projects causing many students to request regrades, which they wouldn\'t receive back for months later. In 2 instances, information in the project description was either wrong or misleading, which caused due dates to get pushed back. This would be fine except Marsh did not compensate the rest of the schedule. This caused the biggest project of the semester to be given a week less to complete.

Although this is true, we have to see if this is a good thing or a bad thing for the students. It might be demoralizing for the professor since he might not be able to interact with a class and you could argue this is bad for the students since some students are lazy and fall behind schedule because ""everything is recorded"". So let\'s analyze this in detail: [+] Bobby provides OH ""relectures"" for people who missed the class. [-] Bobby does not record OH even if people have other classes during the time of OH and sometimes refuses to discuss what was mentioned in detail because he ""discussed it many times in OH"". [-] Some students like me usually will rewatch lectures to fill in missing gaps in our knowledge, not having lectures recorded means we have to go on Piazza but given the next bullet points this isn\'t so ""smooth"". Overall, I think if Bobby wants people to attend lectures, he should find a way to take attendance and leverage it in part with the participation grade. \r\n\r\n[-] Being demeaning to the students: This is an area Bobby needs to work on for sure. You can\'t go out there and call people stupid or get annoyed when people can\'t grasp concepts easily. I\'ve seen instances where he literally said ""this is a stupid question"" even when the question was somewhat relevant. Maybe this might be why he doesn\'t record.......\r\n\r\n[?] Not giving previous exam solutions:  This is probably a blessing in disguise. You are forced to learn where and how to find the information you need instead of having them given to you and just learning through pattern matching. I think this is a good thing but you can easily argue this is a bad thing.\r\n\r\n[?] Projects take up too much time: The tradeoff is that the projects are cool and useful on your CV. If you take this class, you should be informed that it is hard and a lot of work. Don\'t make the mistake of taking this with other hard classes.\r\n\r\n[+] Great Lecturer: Bobby can explain concepts well and you get engaged rather easily\r\n\r\nOverall, Bobby is your stereotypical grandiose narcissist who has a valid reason to be narcissistic.

His homeworks are the same as Eastman\'s, but different from Jason\'s.

Most of the exam problems look just like the ones on the practice midterms but expect a few curveballs.\r\n\r\nAs an instructor, Clyde is objectively frustrating to follow. He\'ll take examples from the slides and change them so that if you don\'t pay close attention the whole time, you may end up lost. \r\n\r\nAsking questions in class is good. He won\'t demoralize you if you have the balls to ask a question, but if you try and answer a question that HE asks, and you get it even slightly wrong, he will not be forgiving. Just before Thanksgiving, he taught a lecture that was like an intro to algorithms, and there were only 15 of us in class that day (weather was bad and it was the day before break). I guessed the answer to one of his problems, and upon learning that I got it wrong, he followed it up with ""I guess you really don\'t know anything."" It\'s objectively a terrible teaching tactic, but the TA\'s will be a lot more helpful in giving constructive feedback during discussions or office hours.\r\n\r\nMy tips for surviving the Clyde:\r\n\r\n1. I definitely wouldn\'t have survived without this. Go to discussion. The TA\'s will go over problems more in-depth than he does and will answer your questions without ridicule. I personally never went to office hours but if that\'s your thing hey more power to you.\r\n2. Do problems from the textbook to prepare for exams. I got a 78 on the first midterm when I didn\'t do this, and then a 98 on the second when I cracked open the book.\r\n3. Look back at the homework to get an idea of the types of questions that can come up on exams. Oftentimes, midterm problems will be carbon copies of these with a few words or numbers changed.\r\n4. Follow along during lecture on a laptop with the lecture slides. I found it helpful to get some notes a minute or two in advance of him covering it. Side note - Jason makes the slides and Clyde lectures on it, so that\'s why it seems like he\'s only reading it for the first time. Also, Clyde will sometimes skip over a lot of slides at once because he feels it\'s not important, but it can be helpful to get a couple more examples under your belt while he\'s rambling.\r\n5. Try to keep your cool. Clyde is so frustrating, I can\'t stress this enough, but if you\'re taking his class, the best you can do is get your bearings and learn more in-depth on your own time (which honestly can be during lecture).\r\n\r\nI hated his class, but I\'m taking 351 next semester with him because I\'m a freshman and register last so wish me luck.', 'rating': 2, 'expected_grade': 'A+', 'created': '2018-12-13T01:55:47Z'}, {'professor': 'Jason Filippou', 'course': 'CMSC250', 'review': ""Jason is disorganized and disrespectful.

Sure, some content could have been explained better, but Cliff made an effort and answered every question during or after lecture. I think the best way to prepare is to read Justin's 250 notes alongside regularly attending lecture. Other than doing the homework (yourself!), you should understand the general content.

If you tackle the material with that attitude you\'re bound to do much better in the class. I have had internship interview questions based on material learned in the class -- so learn the material any way that you can!\n\r\nThe only thing about Golub\'s class is that you need to be in lecture.

Do your best on homework and try to imitate his examples in lecture to get the best grade. Also, definitely do the thought questions -- get a study group. I can\'t stress this tip enough. His exams seemed to be based much more on the thought questions than the homework questions (how convenient..) -- and if you\'ve done the thought questions, you\'re bound to ace the exam.\n\r\nGo to office hours if you are confused about something.

For us, he changed it to 12% lowest midterm, 17% middle midterm, 22% best midterm, and for the homework section (which totalled 150 pts), he took the score out of 125 instead. \n\r\nHe also seems to curve exams arbitrarily..but everyone else has already touched on how he curves. Our first exam was taken out of 88 points, our second was 95, and third 97 or so. I would have expected a much higher curve for the second exam, which makes me wonder where he gets his numbers from (the 12 point curve on the first exam was unnecessarily high, but I\'m not going to complain).\n\r\nAlso, the book is unnecessary.\n\r\nI would have given him 4 stars but if you try to ask him questions right after an exam even if it\'s unrelated, he will yell at you. He is also very condescending sometimes. Even if you have a legitimate question he will cut you off and say ""I\'m not answering those questions right now"" or ""I can\'t solve new problems for you right now"" or ""that\'s not relevant to the topic"" even if a) it\'s a general conceptual question, b) you\'re not asking him to solve a new question, and c) it is relevant to the topic. Golub many times (not always) assumes that his students are idiots and comes off as being extremely mean and as someone else has said, his head can be very far up his ass.\n\r\nFinally, when you\'re taking a test, make sure to get your question across if you have a legitimate question. Many times the TA\'s too (and Golub) may think you\'re fishing for the answer even when you\'re not.

His ""class times"" were just 1 to 1.5 hours of him doing problems that are irrelevant to the lecture or homework material. The homework material was always based on an advanced version of lecture material that you did not learn how to do. The two exams (for my semester) were a grand total of 80% of the final grade, were 6 questions, and consisted of problems 5 levels above what you learn from class material and that I\'m pretty sure he cooked up in his evil layer with the specific purpose of making you cry. Our midterm average as a class was a 44. The final exam average as a class was never released, but the entire class\' grades were so bad that they lowered the final C range to a 41 in the class.

Sometimes the lectures are clear and well-made, but mostly he uses in-class recordings from a couple of years ago, which can be frustrating to watch because of poor audio. The actual content of his lectures are OK though, and I'd say he's overall a decent lecturer. \r\n- The class sessions are used to go over assignments and any extra ramblings. This flipped classroom approach seems nice at first, but the problem is that he assigns a quiz that is due before every class, so you pretty much have to dedicate an hour or two before the class to actually watch the lecture and take the quiz, in addition to the time that you're already spending on homework assignments and studying. \r\n- Exams are crap. Averages are usually in the mid 50s, and make up around 80-85% of your grade (the rest of your grade comes from homework/pre-class quizzes). The fortunate side of this is that Kruskal grades with a huge curve, so you're usually not at risk of outright failing if you're doing about average. In the past, exams used to be based heavily on homeworks, but that seems to have changed this semester, with exams having new problems that are only loosely based on previous homeworks. He also seems to have added a number of different topics this semester that he doesn't usually cover, and this was particularly frustrating because many of the TAs and GSS leaders did not have any familiarity with the material at the tail-end of the semester. \r\n- He outsources pretty much all of his course operations to his TAs, aside from lectures and homework/exam writing.

Essentially, there could be multiple interpretations of a question which could make you believe either true or false based on the interpretation you go with.\r\n\r\nOverall, great professor along with his lectures of course. No doubt about that. He needs to be more straight forward about a few things though.

TA\'s most of the time if you had something not resembling the rubric in a homework assignment, or just because based on their own judgement, will not take their time to read your answer and will not hesitate to slash off as many points as you can as possible (Many times I have gotten back as much as 20%-25% of my assignment just because the TA did not read my answer entirely, and I\'ve had to explain very thoroughly in my regrades). \r\n\r\nI know this is not his fault, but he was very aware of the grading issue because we would get multiple announcements about how there would be over 100s of regrade requests for each assignment and exams. This would not be an issue if the grading was more careful in seeing if the student truly understands the topic instead of how close it is to the rubric, or even something as small if simplifying 1 more step would give the same answer. Oh and what the other reviewer below said is absolutely correct, sometimes I would compare homework answers after grades came out on grade scope, and classmates who wrote the exact same I did would get full credit while I would get -50% off or even the entire question wrong. Same thing if they had the same reasoning for more deep thought questions.  Mind you sometimes you would have to regrade this multiple times to get your points back if the TA\'s were unwilling to check, and it wasn\'t for sure that you would get your points back. \r\n\r\nLastly the reason that also made me give him a not so great review even though I enjoyed having him a lot as my instructor, the above issue of getting massive hundreds of regrades because of extremely inconsistent grading, got so bad that during the last weeks of school after the final they said that since regrade request numbers are always hundreds, they would not allow regrade requests for hw12,hw13 and the final exam. Our homework is worth 28% of our grade and people were relying on this to bring up their averages if they didn\'t drop them, and they even admitted they graded the hw ""leniently"" and the rubric would even say ""anything reasonable even if not correct"". My questions were not read, marked off points without explaining any reason because of the shortness of time with regrades from past assignments, and the final exam also had some grading inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nMy final point, Justin throughout the semester said that the cut-offs would be lowered  slightly below the regular cut offs to account for the grading inconsistencies, the ambiguous writing of questions on exams and etc. This was only 1% or so when confirming when my friends, which if I will be honest, 1% of the entire class is not enough to account to how extremely bad and up to the TA grading your assignments judgement is. And even if Justin offered to contact him regarding grading on hw12,hw13 and the final exam, he would only do this if you were borderline.

It is quite possibly one of the worst taught classes I have ever taken at UMD, mostly because of how its run. \r\n\r\n1. Class Structure - This class is the most disorganized class in the CS department. Jacobs and Duraiswami co-teach, so even if you are in Jacobs\'s section you\'ll still have to deal with lectures from Duraiswami (and vice versa if you\'re in the other section). For some reason the professors thought it was okay to essentially add another ""period"" of mandatory content. We had in-person lecture on Tuesday, and Thursdays were reserved for ""discussion"" where we would do actual practice problems instead of theory. However, before the next week\'s Tuesday lecture, you were expected to watch the recorded lecture from the other section. So basically, even though you only registered for two 1 hr 15 min periods, you effectively had to complete 3 to make the most out of the class. Another issue is that none of the resources are centralized. They post the jamboard from lecture in the resources section of piazza, but discussion problems and jamboards are lost within the sea of piazza questions. Some of them were missing, and in general it was extremely difficult to access the content in a systematic way. \r\n\r\n2. Content -  I ended up self teaching a lot of the content in this class. During lectures, both professors tended to ramble and never really seemed to hit the point. Rather than using structured slides, they taught freely while writing things on a Google Jamboard (essentially a virtual whiteboard). This is fine if you know exactly what you want to talk about, but unfortunately Jacobs had a tendency to make a lot of mistakes and get confused while teaching. I never retained anything from lecture until I googled things on my own to learn them. I also felt like the general flow of topics could have been a little better. \r\n\r\n3. Responsiveness & Grading- This class had one of the worst Piazza response rates. There were times where I would have questions that went over 4 days unanswered. This was especially problematic when a project was due the same week. A lot of times responses were also not that helpful. For example, I remember someone asked for clarification on one of the questions from the final review, and a professor responded with ""I don\'t see what\'s unclear with this solution,"" and then did not respond to the student\'s followup. The grading in the class was also extremely slow. Problem sets and quizzes from the middle of october were only graded in the last couple weeks of the semester. Solutions were not released until the last week either, which made it very difficult to study or even know where you stand in the class before the withdraw deadline. I understand that grading of written problem sets takes time, but in general it felt like there was no communication between instructors and TAs.\r\n\r\nOverall I was extremely disappointed with the class, especially given that I love machine learning. Some pros are that the professors were nice and generally approachable. There was also a decent curve at the end which helped boost a lot of grades. I\'m sure both Jacobs and Duraiswami are smart people, but I think they did a pretty bad job teaching. I would take 422 with different professors if you can.

The course is focused on teaching a lot of different algorithms that are relevant to bioinformatics, but weirdly most of the time he doesn't actually show how they work with examples, so it can be confusing. Also, much less important but the lectures are usually very dry/boring in my opinion.\r\n\r\nProjects:\r\nThere isn't any homework for this class, only projects. He planned to give us 6 projects throughout the semester, but only ended up giving us 4 mandatory projects and a 5th extra credit project because students struggled so much on projects that he was very reluctantly forced to extend the deadlines of 2 projects. For example, the average on the first project was a 50%. It's worth pointing out that he seems out of touch with how difficult these projects are since he seemed confused by how low the average on this project was and the projects only got harder from there. His projects are also graded in a weird way where it can be pretty hard to get partial credit (hence a lot of people getting 0s on them). When he releases a project, you usually have exactly 2 weeks to complete it. Normally, this would be plenty of time to do it.

Some of the material is genuinely difficulty, but the professor is willing to explain it multiple times and in different ways, and to expand things and answer questions during office hours and on Piazza.  Some reviews on here complain about the workload, but if you're taking a 400 level CS class at UMD and you can't put together an algorithm covered in the class or figure out how to compile a program from the command line, you're gonna have a bad time. Personally, I thought the projects required effort but were totally fair.\r\n\r\nThe material was super interesting, and we learned about data structures that have runtimes I wouldn't have even though were possible before I took this class. What I learned about dynamic programming alone was worth it. The exams definitely made you think, but were fair — they tested your knowledge of the data structures and algorithms we learned by asking you to use them to solve problems that would be very difficult otherwise.  The averages on the exams were on the low end, but there was a huge curve and the professor was very clear about this up front.  Also, there was a ton of extra credit offered.  Overall, I loved this class. If you're looking for an easy, low-effort 400 level class, don't take this! But if you're willing to put in effort and want to learn some really cool data structures and algorithms, I can't recommend this class highly enough."", 'rating': 5, 'expected_grade': 'B+', 'created': '2022-05-19T22:32:14Z'}, {'professor': 'Robert Patro', 'course': 'CMSC423', 'review': 'Patro is a very, very lovely gentleman.

That being said, I found the book to be a bit dry and ambiguous at certain points (especially the 3rd chapter) and it definitely took a lot of getting used to. Still, it's a pretty solid book (especially considering that it's the first proof based undergrad crypto textbook on the market) and Katz does a good job of following the content well.\n\r\nAnother of Katz's strengths is that he's VERY open to taking questions and will elegantly field even the dumbest possible questions you could ever imagine. In all seriousness though, he's always willing to take questions and clarify points. Given that crypto is a pretty comprehensive and complex subject this is very important and very helpful.\n\r\nNow for (what I thought were) the not-so-good aspects of Katz's teaching style. For one thing, I personally found  that the way he communicated just wasn't very easy to learn from. It wasn't just that the course was hard either -- I found that even when Katz lectured on stuff that I already knew that the message he was trying to get across was vague and difficult to wrap one's head around. It's hard to explain -- that's just how I felt about his teaching style.\n\r\nAlso, I felt that his homeworks were a huge pain and didn't really help very much to get across the content of the course.

Four weeks later it must be completely finished supporting 15 different operations, along with a text-based command parser, makefile, etc. All code must be completely from scratch, and you\'ll need to implement a linked list, a heap, and a binary search tree (heh heh) during this time to finish your quadtree.

My biggest gripe is that by using pre-written notes, he was able to cover so much material, to the point where it was overwhelming. He does provide a lot of forms of the material which is nice. For each lecture, he had latex notes, handwritten notes (he presented these in class), in-person lecture video, and a prerecorded video where he creates and explains the handwritten notes. As others mention, he is a bit more theory-heavy than some other profs. The course was overall easy (except for exams... which required a lot of prep but were mostly fair), but I will be honest in that I don't feel like I learned much. This is because the projects were simple enough where they didn't really require too much understanding and the homework was infrequent enough that you could get away with just trying to match the lecture notes procedures, rather than truly understand them. Some of this is my fault for sure, but the limited amount of assignments meant I wasn't practicing concepts. Anyway, I would say the course is fairly easy except for exams. Mount is a very nice guy though and he'll tell you if you're on the right track with homework and other assignments. Last thing, you are allowed one two-sided cheat sheet for each exam, and you can bring previous cheat sheets to subsequent exams (one sheet for first exam, two for second exam, three for final).

Taking CMSC456 before this class will give you a slight advantage (very slight).\n\r\nQuizzes:\r\nThere were 3 quizzes which were pretty hard. They are all short answer or diagram drawing. I felt the quizzes would emphasize a random subset of the material covered, so if you are weak on a certain topic and it shows up on the exam you are screwed. On the other hand it could not show up at all and you get lucky.\n\r\nProjects:\r\nThe projects were actually pretty fun as we got to carry out things like buffer overflows, dictionary attacks, and XSS attacks. They also more or less got easier as the semester went on. Languages used were C, Java, and Javascript. He provides resources and examples if you don't know Javascript, I taught myself everything I needed to know for the Javascript coding in less than an hour.\n\r\nFinal:\r\nIt was a little harder than the quizzes I thought.

One qualm that is valid that I see echoed here, however, is that the projects sometimes do not have enough set up or foundation for someone who is new to these security concepts to finish thoroughly. I am biased because I came into this class with some general knowledge and experience with how security worked, so the buffer overflow project, the XSS project, and other projects were pretty good.

If you take notes on paper, learn to do it by computer, or you will get crazy pissed when he hops all over the place modifying what he wrote. My personal suggestion is Microsoft OneNote. Of course, he posts the notes file online, so you don't really need to take notes, but I would advise you do so, particularly if you're not that familiar with the subject.\n\r\nHe involves the class by basically asking us questions and writing the answers in his VI file. He writes it very colloquially which is nice, but sometimes he uses really obnoxiously large, outmoded words (draconian, pathological etc.).\n\r\nThe way the lectures go will be entirely up to you and your classmates. In my case, my classmates were total geniuses. We have 1 guy who got a diploma from MIT, half the robotics team, and a bunch of other people who basically know everything there is to know about linux.\n\r\nThese people will be the bane of your existence if you are not one of them. They will side track the class, ask really convoluted and (in my opinion) irrelevant questions, and basically confuse the HELL out of you.\n\r\nIt is basically your job to slow these people down and make sure they don't get too many opportunities to derail the class.\n\r\nNeil also gives quizzes if someone's cell phone goes off in the class. So, study your notes every night basically. He also has a huge vocab sheet he posts at the beginning of the semester, with words that will be covered on his multiple choice exams.\n\r\nNow some of you may have seen me say multiple choice, and grinned happily; set aside that notion, Neil's exams are pretty damn bad. His questions are more tricks than tests of knowledge, there are several that can be interpreted to mean different things, and it's really anyone's guess as to what they truly ask. Other questions can sometimes reword the answers in such a way that even if you know what the answer is, finding them among the choices is tricky.\n\r\nThe projects in this course are pure hell for the most part with 1 or 2 exceptions. This isn't really Neil's fault, he delegated it all to his TA, who mismanaged time a fair amount (routinely showed lecture slides for projects 3 weeks before they were ASSIGNED).\n\r\nOverall, it's not easy to review this course, as I don't know if it's me, the TA, the professor, or the course itself that's the problem, but I do put in 40 ish hours a week for out of class work, and I have a C-.\n\r\nNeil is a fair guy though, so I am not too worried about failing/passing.\n\r\nIf you want an A in this class, and haven't been weaned on linux, then you will need to start reading the book weeks before the semester begins.

I enrolled in this class because I thought that Operating Systems is a fundamental and useful skill to learn, even if difficult, but found out that the administration of this class makes this 10x more harder for literally no reason. There are so many things wrong with this course that I wouldn\'t recommend ANYONE taking it because it\'s not worth it. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, others seemed to like the professor\'s lecturing ability, but I did not. He goes on tangents all the time and is very unclear in his statements that it is impossible to focus. The slides are comprehensive, but are taken straight from the textbook so that isn\'t really a credit to the professor.\r\n\r\nThe projects and exams though, that is a different hell. Let\'s talk projects. Each one is incredibly difficult, and the instructions are HORRIBLE. There is really no valid reason why there should be a spec, slides, and FAQ for EVERY SINGLE PROJECT. The spec is awfully written and flat out wrong about things, the project slides are vague and also have incorrect information. The FAQs don\'t answer certain questions with any new information, and the fact that an FAQ is even needed for a project means that the instructions are poorly written. And to make things worse, even the spec, slides, and FAQ are sometimes not enough. \r\n\r\nOn a related note, administration for this course was TRULY TERRIBLE. Questions on Piazza were just left unanswered even though there were many people with the same question; the TAs just didn\'t answer and weren\'t active. I\'m pretty sure they were also left in the dark about logistics in the class, because it was near the end of the semester and we STILL did not have breakdowns of grading. That part of the course website was just never filled out. And one of our pop quizzes, which we only had 10 minutes to do and had a very poor average, was worth almost an entire project grade. That is completely ridiculous and shows how little the professor cares about administration for this class. For exams, we didn\'t get any review material, no study guide or previous exams, zip, zilch, nada. Just ""look at the slides"" which are hundreds if not thousands of slides so it\'s impossible to study everything on it. In addition, for our final, the professor was very unaccommodating to concerns over the Omicron variant, and refused to move the final online despite multiple CS classes shifting online, and almost the entire class requesting this change. No reasoning was given, of course. \r\n\r\nLastly, our final exam, which is worth a quarter of our final grade, was put on the grade server, and we never even got it back to see what we got wrong, let alone a regrade request. It was simply put on Testudo. This fact may change since this review is posted, but nevertheless it is inexcusable to have these final grades submitted without students seeing the reason, especially when this resource is easily available via Gradescope. \r\n\r\nI get that Operating Systems is a hard concept, but like I said, the administration made this course needlessly more difficult. I am sure that most other people in the class agree with me regarding the majority of the points that I raised here, and there are probably more points that I didn\'t mention. These points are definitely fixable (having clear grading, clear project descriptions, enforcing Piazza answering, giving us study material) and should definitely be addressed the next time this course is taken.

To be honest if you actually go to class arrive on time and pay attention you should be able to learn from him. \r\nThe projects were nit-picky, but that is because he has a program grade them to ensure accuracy (But I must say most of the projects were pretty easy for me, although many of my classmates struggled).\r\nThe tests were a little more difficult just because I find it hard to write code on paper (you have to write a short program for most tests).\r\nQuizzes in discussion were announced and generally just quickly reviewing the previous two lectures would give you enough information to get ~36/40 on the quiz.\r\nSeriously if Herman is the worst lecturer in the CS department then the department must have the best lecturers on campus because he really wasn't that bad.\r\nP.S. go to class and pay attention it really helps even if you don't think it does.\n\r\nI also took CMSC131 with Herman:\r\nSame as above pretty much, a lot of people just have no logic and do not belong in computer programming classes (or the major).

I found discussion useless since I program in C and Java at my job but didn't feel prepared enough to test out of 131. However since unannounced quizzes were given in discussion, so I had to go. Yet Herman forbade the TA from telling ANYONE when the quizzes were. So each student was forced to either (a) go to every single discussion where the TA (who was horrendous, by the way) mumbled insensibly for an hour or (b) try to guess when the quizzes were and attend discussion on those days.

Fawzi can't review every topic with a fine tooth comb because it's only a semester-long course, therefore the rate at which new material is introduced is fast.

I CAN'T STRESS THAT ENOUGH. \n\r\nNow that I'm done addressing those who might be new to programming entirely, let me broaden my view to everyone taking the class. Fawzi's tests are perfectly fair. Not too easy, but definitely not hard as well. Study well, and you'll do fine. PAY ATTENTION TO THOSE STUDY QUESTIONS. They're the keys to a good test score.

As you embark on your journey through the mystifying complex universe of computer science, you have no idea what to expect. You could be dealing with the unforeseen; singularities caused by Eclipse phenomenons, encounters with fierce, atrocious bugs on the submit server, or even bang you head on your very own $800 laptop as you scream at the ambiguous results of the release tests! A toilet bowl of intellectual thoughts flurries around your noggin; there could be computers, video games, cameras, programming, computers, flying cellphones, virtual pinball and more!\r\nThen all of a sudden.\r\nBAM!\r\nGolub's hairstyle is crazy – he’s like the Yoda of comp sci. Don't underestimate his powers.\r\nAs soon as you walk through the door, the surrounding air temperature drops 30 degrees as you witness the epitome of the human race. A majestic white haired dude strides across the lecture hall and spreads his arms openly– with a devilish grin on his face – so fast you could have blinked and missed the moment of a lifetime. (I strongly advise bringing a camera to savor the moment)\r\nGolub E., or professionally known as “Evan de Golub”, is a retired super villain who now only uses his powers for forces of good….. for students of the CMSC major at the University of Maryland. He wears a silk vest every day - except on every other Friday. However, I personally felt like when he wasn't wearing the vest his lectures were more interesting and remained on topic. (Escalating theories in the scientific community that this very vest may have been part of his original super villain costume - and retains faint traces of pure evil.)\r\nHis vest is swaggy doe. Props to him.\r\nAlthough his receding hairline may fool you upon first glance, he has a magnificent pony tail and has the full-fledged back-head experience. But keep in mind he is no Lebron James. Golub is an extremely young person – his hair is only grey from an abundance of knowledge and sagacious wisdom he has accumulated throughout his career. (One, of course, which would take the average man many lifetimes to equal.) Golub is a young warrior, holding years of experience computer sciencing, playing wacky poker in the devious back rooms of mobster hideouts, taking photographs of people’s feet and farm animals, and executing simulations of the mass genocide of pond fishies. But don’t let me spoil the extravagant, Oscar-worthy backstory though. Let the Golub himself reveal it to you through his eloquent novel-worthy lectures which leave you hanging on an epic, thrilling cliff hanger after each 51 minute session. But don’t worry my fellow Golub-goers, he always comes back the next week to continue the story almost where he left off, even after he has given tests that were not on the future topics he touched in the lectures – but on the stuff you should’ve KNOWN ALL ALONG FROM THE START. Damn, this guy practically wrote Inception. (Before Christopher Nolan bought the rights to it.) \r\nAnyway, at first his lectures might seem pointless, spontaneous, random, unconnected, irrelevant, boring, and really confusing - but don’t let that fool you.  In each session there is a small ten second topic that will become a pivotal test question somewhere down the road. Trust me. All of the spontaneous, random, unconnected, irrelevant, boring, and really confusing tangents he goes on are actually tests, testing the mental capacity of all 140 stude– I mean 45 students who bother to show up- in search for a new padawan. So if you want the prestigious position of “Golub padawan” on your resume, it’s best you sign up right now and claim your first row seat.\r\nI strongly advise not bringing a computer to his lecture – this only distracts you from the true Golub-glorified experience. His signature hand gestures during his elegant lectures engage full houses of students – from all over the world- elevating them to the balls of their feet as he tells witty jokes that no one listens to. Seriously, one time someone almost let out a giggle and the whole universe practically collapsed inward upon itself and imploded. \r\nI suggest bringing the classic pen and notepad – which were the slim-lined computers Golub himself used when growing up in college – not those vintage clay tablets developed by the Mayans. (They’re too intricate for the average man!) No matter which type of device you plan to bring, always stare at it and never make eye contact with the master while he speaks – this is a sign of challenge, an instinct Golub has picked up from his years chillin with lions and tigers and preforming weird combos to their portraits.\r\nGolub is a man with an infinite bag of tricks – did you know he was bilingual? Early on he’ll amaze you with a programming project that no only asks you to prompt the user in English, but also in SPANISH?!!?! hhhhoooooowwwWWHHHHAAAAAAA?!!?!?! This man is a genius. You’ll soon learn the concept of accounting for different cultural values and measurement systems because Golub exposes the flaws of NASA and unit conversions. During his reign as supervillain, Golub encountered the forces of NASA and recollects how the US measurement of distance was different that Europe’s system, causing the NASA probe to crash (wasting the hundreds of millions of dollars Golub could have used for world domination). He references this story at least once every week, which now in hindsight, I think was a reoccurring subliminal message for comp sci students: don’t trust NASA.\r\nNot only will you embark on pointless, unnecessary projects while other classes are sticking closer to reality, Golub will personally teach you the secrets to his mischievous trade of the wacky poker underground. His wacky poker project seemed too wacky for my taste, but then again, I was never playing a high stakes poker game with 300 zoo animals on the line. Golub is truly a modern superhero. When I took this class I never expected to learn essential life skills including: what Rwanda’s flag looks like in 3 bit-resolution, how to do calculus in Martianese notation, how to program, or even the science behind a fish pond exploiting the true concepts of Darwinism. \r\nBut now I know, and I shall hold on to these precious gifts dearly as I move on with my life.\r\nIf you have been missing a real Bill Nye the science guy in your life, then this is the opportunity of a life time. Golub is a golden star, which luckily this review system can represent for future generations yet to come.\n\r\n1st out of 5 stars\r\nWould take again…… And audit too if forced by gunpoint.\n"", 'rating': 1, 'expected_grade': 'F+', 'created': '2015-01-30T17:16:00Z'}, {'professor': 'Evan Golub', 'course': 'CMSC131', 'review': ""Terrible professor.

However, she cannot teach at all.  She is incredibly confusing, boring, and only she tends to know what she is talking about.

You get a guideline on what you have to do and you have to use what you have learned from lecture.

I would have the expectation that each one will take at least 8 hours. start them as soon as they are released and bounce ideas of friends as much as you can.

His exams are doable as long as you do the past exams/practice he gives which is really helpful. His third exam; however, was overly long and challenging compared to his others so it tanked a lot of people's grades, but he just released grades and seemed to have provided a better cutoff to benefit (f.e. some A grades were considered A+ and so on), so as long as you put the work in you should be golden in terms of your grade (it's not meant to be challenging to get an A or B).

I thought they were all fair questions - study the study questions and notes from lecture, as well as last quizzes. Quizzes were basically weekly and also fair.

He is really laid back, chill, and constantly makes jokes and finds interesting ways to keep students engaged. This was my first time coding in Java and Nelson made it very straight forward and doable.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- Nelson is a very funny and likable guy. On the first day of classes he will tell you that he always wants you to call him by his first name which I found interesting.\r\n- He is very good at making analogies between programming and more understandable topics. For example, he would make an analogy between a bakery and objects in java. This makes it really easy to understand his teaching, even for first time programmers like me.\r\n- His lecture slides are much more detailed than Fawsi\'s (from what I have heard)\r\n- His exams are very much like the previous exams. As long as you study those, and the additional resources that Nelson provides, you will be more than fine on the exams.\r\n- Occasionally during every lecture, Nelson likes to say ""1 minute"" which indicates that we can talk to our neighbor for a minute and digest the information that he just lectured about. I found this useful and made the class less fast paced— gave me time to breathe while learning new information. After this minute break, he opens the floor for a few questions before returning to his lecture.\r\n- Nelson uploads the code for every class example and provides many many resources to ensure you do well on the projects and exams.\r\n- Grading for exams is honestly pretty lenient. Because all the midterms include hand-written coding, it is easy to miss the small nuances that come with programming but the TAs that grade your tests know this. Often times when you look at the grading break down, you are given points on a segment of code just for ""ATTEMPTING to _______""\r\n- Very accommodating in regards to extending deadlines for things. He even encourages that the class speaks up if we need an extension.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- His funny personality sometimes gets in the way of the actual teaching. Yes it does lighten up the mood but often he will stop mid sentence just to pop in a joke. Additionally, some of his comedy is offensive or will get stale. For example, he once made a statement to the guys in the class about how they should not feel bad if a girl rejects them. He then goes on with his joke and says that girls are like ""instance variables"" and how the guys should just ""pick another one"" if one doesn\'t work. If you know anything about Java, you will know that he basically just called women ""objects"". I didn\'t think too much about this but I can see why some people would find his humor offensive. He also always makes the joke ""turn to your neighbor and tell them they are a (insert random java terminology)"" which literally makes no sense and gets old after the first couple times.\r\n- The third midterm was a nightmare. In the past, there have only been two midterms and the third was only added a couple years ago. This means that there is little study material and the worst part is that the second and third midterm are only 2 weeks apart since they kind of just shoved it into the curriculum. The class average for midterms is usually pretty high but dropped to a D average for this midterm. Nelson did adjust the letter grade cut offs for final grades because of this though.\r\n- Projects become very challenging towards the end of the semester. This is obviously necessary to challenge students but sometimes they are impossible to figure out without a TA.\r\n- Frankly, sometimes it is difficult to understand his accent and it leaves you to think more about what words he is saying in the first place rather than the actual content within his sentences.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think Nelson is the better option for CMSC131. He is very knowledgable and it is clear that he comes prepared for class with examples to explain complex ideas to new programmers. Just beware of his random remarks. It is clear that he is looking for validation and wants to be liked by his students so he makes jokes on topics that students our age would find ""funny"".

If anything, the TAs are more helpful than Nelson himself.\r\n- As anecdotal evidence, he created a 3rd exam (in the past there were only 2) which covered a bunch of topics. I went to the exam review and the TA told us not to review this one topic. Next thing you know that topic is on the exam!!! I heard that half of the class did POORLY on that exam (including me).

I never have an office hour with Fawzi, but the TAs are more than enough (he recruits amazing ones). \r\n\r\nThere are 3 advices to give to new students who take his class:\r\n1. DO NOT SKIP CLASS! Fawzi posts lecture slides but most are similar to outlines. To truly understand it, it\'s better to attend classes and see his thinking processes with examples and drawings. He is strict with time, so he prioritizes delivering all the contents he has for the lecture first then asking questions second.\r\n2. START PROJECTS EARLY! The day Fawzi posts the announcement that the next project is available is the day you should start right away! The TAs are there to help you. Immediately go to them if you don\'t know how to start. Don\'t wait until the last 4 days, unless you love being in a long queue of ~20 students (each takes like 5 minutes, give or take another 5).\r\n3. REVIEW LECTURES WEEKLY! Fawzi usually gives weekly quizzes and it\'s a good way to know what you need to review for midterms.

He is really into himself, and if you get in his way he will stomp you into the ground. Yes, he will teach you what you need to know, but he makes it fairly obvious that he doesn't care much about the students, but more about the fact that his boss wants him to teach in a certain way.

Some of the tests will have not much concepts, but some stupid esoteric stuff about Java that does not really matter.\r\nAnother big problem was that he used lecture slides made by the department that he didn't like.

I decided to go to his office hours to try and clarify my question. However, he would not even let me finish my question before interrupting, and repeatedly telling me my confusion regarding the project was because I had not read the public tests (which is a solution not remotely related to my original question). He was very rude and discourteous the entire time I was in his office.\n\r\nHe uses Piazza (sort of like a forum), under the pretense of having TAs or fellow students being able to help answer questions regarding the class. However, he only uses Piazza as a way to avoid answering nuanced questions himself.

He never seemed to want to look me in the eye when I tried to ask him questions before or after lecture, and talks like a robot at times. He is not the greatest lecturer: he repeats himself often and kept saying that he was ""behind"" for the last 5 weeks or so of the semester. During that time he didn\'t really ask if there were questions on the new material, but is very responsive if you go to his office hours or ask for help outside of class. Very strict about the ""No laptops or electronics"" policy...he kicks people out of class for texting during lecture. I think he got his count up to 20 between two of his three lecture periods when I was in 132 with him. \n\r\nSwitching gears though, Mr. Herman is very knowledgeable about Java and the computer programming paradigm. His lecture slides are an amazing resource, sometimes better than the textbook (which, for 132, I highly recommend you get, even if you’re a Java expert, as it contains a lot of powerful concepts and goes into detail on some foggy areas beyond the 132 curriculum that are still good to know).\n', 'rating': 3, 'expected_grade': 'B+', 'created': '2015-04-06T01:17:00Z'}, {'professor': 'Larry Herman', 'course': 'CMSC132', 'review': ""I would like to start off by saying that Herman is not as bad as many people say. I feel that most of the low reviews he gets are from freshmen who are not prepared for the amount of work this class will take. With that being said, I will give you as honest a review of him as I can. Keep in mind that this is my second high level programming class (I'm an EE major so I already saw many of the concepts presented in this class in my 150 class)\n\r\nI'll start off with the bad. Herman can be kind of an asshole at times. He follows his syllabus to the letter, so if he specifies that he  will only answer programming questions in office hours, HE WILL ONLY ANSWER THEM IN OFFICE HOURS. Like even for simple yes or no questions, he will only answer them during office hours which can get really annoying.\n\r\nHis exams are another negative point. For a 100 level programming class, I felt that there were unnecessarily difficult, and this was having already seen most of these concepts in another class already. His exams are often extremely specific, sometimes testing concepts that were only vaguely mentioned during a lecture and are often unnecessary to know for practical programming purposes.\n\r\nWith that being said, Herman is an extremely good teacher. I honestly thought he was a good lecturer, may not have been the most interesting but hey, you try and keep this stuff interesting through 5 different lectures of the same topic. If you want to be successful in this class, go to his lectures as much as possible. I would also recommend using his office hours a lot, not because he will only answer questions during them but also if you ask him a question then you will get a detailed and thorough answer that will almost surely help you. \n\r\nLike I said, I have seen most of the programming concepts presented in this class in a previous coding class, however, I still found his projects to be rather straight forward. If this is your first high level programming class I would suggest starting early, but you should not have difficulty completing them on time and getting a good score on the project.\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend Herman if you really want to learn the topics presented in 132.

You need to understand and memorize EVERYTHING he mentions, even in passing, to excel in the class, and you need to start on programming projects much sooner rather than later because they are deceptive when you first read the description.\n\r\nIn detail:\r\nMr. Herman is the best lecturer I have had in the past five semesters. In addition to knowing the course material, he is typically capable of conveying it to the class. His M.O. is to lecture using PowerPoint slides, asking the class if they understand before he discusses examples. MOST of these slides are posted on Blackboard a few days later, but they often have questions without answers on them. The examples that he presents in class are always basic illustrations of the topic at hand. He also maintains the class\'s interest when he talks about the more pedantic aspects of OOP by seamlessly working brief, amusing comments into his lectures.\n\r\nOn the other hand, however, I must remark that the class is heavily geared toward audial instruction. That is, the ""learn by doing"" aspect of the class is lacking. I was disappointed that there was little middle ground when it came to the difficulty of assignments. While the worksheets in discussion were similar in difficulty to the lecture examples, projects were significantly time-consuming. Part of this may have been because while I personally learn best by reading the book/writing code, the text for the class only discusses data structures, and not other  topics covered in the class (Out of five, only the second and third projects focused predominantly on creating data structures. The first was a review of CMSC131, the fourth was about graph traversal, and the fifth was about multithreading, I/O, and connecting to the Internet).\n\r\nFurthermore, tests were obnoxious, in the sense that perhaps 20% of each test dealt with trivia. In the case of the final, this took the form of, ""Do you happen to remember this fact about Java that I mentioned offhand halfway through the semester, and that you probably never used when you were completing the projects?"" The rest of each test was either writing code or tracing a program. The grading is stringent - I recall losing 8% on the second exam because I implemented (correctly) an O(n^2) algorithm instead of an O(n log(n)) algorithm. Basically, in most cases, it does not suffice in this class to get your program to compile and function correctly; you must also write it efficiently and know other ways you could have achieved the same functionality.\n\r\nAll in all, Mr. Herman has been my second-favorite teacher at UMD (after Prof. James Schafer of the Math department), and a few, but not all, of my complaints about the class are not his fault. I was actually signed up for Mr. Emad\'s section of 132 at the beginning of the semester, but I switched out immediately after sitting in on one of Mr. Herman\'s lectures. Best decision so far of my college career.\n\r\nOne final note: as you progress through the class, make a condensed version of your notes to serve as a rudimentary study guide for exams.

However, I really enjoyed his teaching style. He gives plenty of examples of concepts, and he puts a significant amount of effort into making comprehensive practice exams and homework assignments so that you are well prepared for the midterms. You can also download his slides and (some) code examples after class to further examine them. \r\n\r\nHe does not allow electronic devices in class, and if he catches you using one, he will not hesitate to call you out. I thought that was annoying at first, but his philosophy is that you should be actively listening to his commentary rather than writing everything down on the slides. In fact, when he sees people writing slide material in their notebooks, he won\'t stop them but he will interject with something like ""you don\'t have to write this stuff down because the slides will be on ELMS later."" I think that his philosophy worked well for me, but your mileage may vary of course. He is also very knowledgeable about Java and the Object-Oriented paradigm and will write notes to himself to correct unclear information in his slides or to investigate the answer to a question he was asked.\r\n\r\nThe homework comes in the form of coding projects. His project descriptions are very well defined (albeit lengthy) and help reinforce the material covered in lectures. However, they are graded pretty slowly (the last four projects have not been graded yet as I write this review), but maybe that will change in the future. \r\n\r\nHe also makes a good attempt to engage with his students. He frequently asks questions throughout the lecture to his students and corrects them if necessary. As a bonus, I think he genuinely wants to entertain us and be friendly. For one, he always suggested saying your name when you answered a question. During the last half of the semester, he raffled chocolate and other candy using a specialized program he made.

(NOTE: I had Nelson first semester and received a very good grade so 132 with Fawzi was a shock. I have completed the course but chose to leave it optional out of confidentiality).\r\n\r\nFawzi is too fast paced in lecture. On top of that his powerpoint are next to useless and he doesn't record lectures. On top of that he doesn't give fair exams in my opinion. I will admit the midterms were fair, but they test the smallest details which you wouldn't need in the real world or which a compiler would pick up. For example, on one of the exams I declared a variable incorrectly, with the rest of my code is logically and syntax correct I only received 2/14 points. I approach external TA's who said I should receive points, but when I approached Fawzi on the regrade he refused to give points back and gave an excuse as to why. In additions we only had 2 exams unlike other classes, where they would split we had all of OO(Object oriented programming) and the entire second exam on every DS (data structure). \r\n\r\nOutside of the course work to sum up Fawzi in a few words:\r\n- shrewd/out right disrespectful \r\n    - Doesn't help in office hours. Always acts like he's better and we know nothing.\r\n- not lenient at all\r\n     - Was sick and couldn't make it for a quiz. Fawzi told me either to come for the quiz or receive a 0 (this was the second time I was sick and couldn't use a self attested note). Especially for a time while we are still in a pandemic this was out right disrespectful and foolish that he is willing to risk the health of his TA's and students for a quiz.  \r\n- doesn't care about his students mental or physical health\r\n   - Over this semester I was struggling with my mental health a bit and when I approached Fawzi about his essential response was I don't care. He is not as nice and caring as nelson, I didn't receive any help throughout the course during this. Outside of that office hours were always packed and the TA's were quite bad. \r\n- comes off as some high achieving professor with lots of publications and no time for his students when in reality he's a lecture (massive ego problem)\r\n\r\nOutside of this his class is taught like we are all high end comp sci people who know what we're doing. His exams once again are more difficult than nelsons. If you could I would avoid Fawzi at all cost and take Nelson. Nelson was one of the best professors I've had across all departments. \r\n\r\nOther Notes (sorry if repetitive to some other parts of the review):\r\n- Doesn't give practice exams\r\n- Doesn't tell us a concept list like Nelson or any other teachers\r\n- Refuses to record lecture \r\n- Steep late penalty (20% off your highest score if submitted at or after 11pm. 100% off after submitting 24hrs after the deadline).\r\n- 1 practice packet with questions that don't resemble exams a week\r\n- Quizzes were very hard for weekly assignments (we also didn't know the context)\r\n- Purposely goes into harder concepts which aren't relevant material to the course (refers to 351 and theoretical CS concepts we don't learn a lot). \r\n- Final Exam is the worst. 30% of the grade. Everything we wouldn't have been tested on for an FRQ was there. You cannot expect first time students with no experience to come in and redo parts of their project by hand. You cannot make students code out concepts you referred to for 5minutes in a lecture. You cannot make students code a question we have never seen a code example for and something which was barely touched in class. A final is cumulative that includes everything we were taught not everything after the midterms and the concepts we barely went over. \r\n- Labs also aren't too helpful and I think he should adjust the labs to have a due date of completion so students actually do then and cut down on the weight of the final exam. a final worth 30% dropped by grade from B to (well you can do the math for that :)). \r\n- Projects in others classes are worth way more overall than ours. \r\n\r\nFinal thoughts: I wish I took nelson when I had the opportunity to while registering. If I could go back into that time and choose nelson I would've probably got a B+ at the lowest. Nelson's exams side by side Fawzi's are much easier on relevant materials and won't make or break your grade such as Fawzi. Unlike the other reviews I can't say that he enjoys teaching.

I will however say that he uses his pencil and a paper to visualize what he is describing, and his handwriting is very ineligible and he has to erase so many times that I can\'t help but bother about the amount of eraser dust he produces.

I\'m not sure if he is ""rude"" per se as I haven\'t had a proper conversation with him, and he can be pretty sweet like asking ""how are you?"" to his students, but when someone asks him questions, he can be really condescending.

Maybe I was asking dumb questions to his eyes, because he does seem to love whenever his top students ask advanced questions during the lecture.\r\n\r\nI think he also makes his exams on his own, and in my opinion, those are much harder than the practice exams provided by the department. I did decently on the second midterm and the final exam, but I did pretty badly on the first midterm, which hurt my grade the most, because I had no idea his exams would be as difficult.

The projects were not graded but you get to argue with and against Dr. Kruskal and he is so much fun to argue with. Overall, Dr. Kruskal is really passionate about his math and he is very funny.

Seeing the CMSC250H, enticed me into the class because I thought, oh cool a CS honors class, that sounds like a cool experience. However, CMSC250H is quite a misleading name for this course. The name for this course should be MATH250H because this is almost entirely a math class (Discrete Mathematics: Proofs, inductions, probability, combinatorics).\r\n\r\nIn the honors version of the class, you go much faster on topics, you actually learn some coding stuff, and you do alot of problems related to Gasarch\'s books and research (the research part sounds cool at first, but as someone who finds math boring, it really isn\'t that fun). So every week we had a Honors homework assignment due Monday 9am sharp and a regular homework assignment ""due Monday 9am"", however Gasarch has this thing called ""dead cat policy"", which is essentially a free extension until Wednesday 9am (y\'a know, incase your cat dies).\r\n\r\nThe homeworks are quite challenging intellectually, and studying/working on them with classmates is the way to go. On that topic, the class is significantly smaller than the non honors section which is a good and bad thing. It\'s a good thing because you actually get to have a professor who knows what your name is and you get to meet some great friends who struggle with you. The bad thing is, this class essentially simulates a small pond environment, in which basically you are trapped in a class where 80% of the kids are geniuses and if you aren\'t a genius you constantly feel stupid.\r\n\r\nThe honors homeworks are honestly hit or miss. Most of the time they include a mini/short coding project in which you could code in whatever language you wanted using whatever packages and etc you wanted (I used Java), these can get time consuming, but are usually much shorter than the regular homeworks. \r\n\r\nNote: Make sure you do your homework cause its like 30% of the grade and it really does come clutch in the gradebook. And also the homework is graded for accuracy so you do need to work hard on it, and it is great to have a study group to compare answers with.\r\n\r\nNow the exams. So in this semester what Gasarch did was he would often have a take home part and a non take home part. The take home part would be like 25-30 pts of the final and would usually take a long time to do. The timed part of the final would be 2 hours, and he would say they were open note and open internet (though the internet wouldn\'t really help). The exams were quite easy in comparison to the homework problems, however if you tripped up on a problem, you tend to fall. On the first midterm i got a 90 while the second i got a 70.\r\n\r\nNow as for Gasarch himself. This man is a straight up genius, which means if you aren\'t a genius, you will get lost often and quite fast in his words. He loves to crack jokes and be sarcastic which is a plus, but sometimes he is a straight up ""not nice guy"". If you give a wrong answer, he is the type of person to laugh at you, or lecture you about ""guessing"" (even though most of the class only answers by guesses) - happened to one of my friends, he is scarred for life now. I was once in a one on one zoom call with him talking about some problems and he was straight up being extremely rude to me and aggressive for almost no reason at all (maybe bad mood idk). He also 100% plays favorites so get on his good side. He goes at supersonic speed in his lectures, and doesn\'t do many practice problems so it is not fun trying to figure out what is even going on in the homework problems. In class we did a bunch of topics from his life\'s research, most notably, Muffin Mathematics, while memorable, can be quite tedious.\r\n\r\nThe TA for this class was honestly a saving grace and she helped us in so many ways (Thank you Emily). This class is definitely Hard, not impossible but definitely Hard. There will be times where you question why you took the honors section instead of the regular section - this happened to me a lot. But in the end of the class, Gasarch ended up giving an extremely generous curve (allegedly the TA had to convince him to give a curve) in which 85% curved to an A, 77-B,70-B-,60-C, no one got lower.\r\n\r\nSo I guess in the end, the honors section of this class is definitely challenging, however, you may actually end up with a higher grade than what you could have gotten in the regular section of this course and I definitely loved the small class size. Gasarch loves math, this course is not a CS course, it is a math course, he flies by the material and is definitely not the best at explaining advanced concepts (not to mention almost all his slides have like a million typos) for simple minds. If you are a math prodigy or are good with this stuff then you will cruise easily, if you aren\'t then this class will be a fight, but I definitely would take the honors section of this class again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'rating': 3, 'expected_grade': 'A', 'created': '2021-05-18T11:17:02Z'}, {'professor': 'William Gasarch', 'course': 'CMSC250H', 'review': ""Gasarch is definitely going to present an intellectually harder course than the regular 250 section but I think he's worth it. You are forced to think creatively and out of the box which helps in other subjects. Also, his tests are not that hard."", 'rating': 5, 'expected_grade': 'A', 'created': '2021-05-20T02:54:06Z'}, {'professor': 'William Gasarch', 'course': 'CMSC250H', 'review': ""Probably the most favorite CS class I've taken at UMD so far. As a disclaimer, this class probably doesn't prepare you well for 351 compared to regular 250 because of how fast-paced and how quickly topics are gone through, but 250H does go over necessary topics such as induction (at a much faster pace) so it's not a big deal at the end of the day. Gasarch is an incredibly intelligent professor who goes through topics very quickly, and he sometimes expects you to understand them immediately which may not be possible at all times. Another problem with this class at times is the number of typos or changes to the assignments which can get pretty annoying. This is probably the biggest downside to this class as you should expect every assignment or untimed midterm to have a few typos so make sure to send questions through Piazza or email if you see anything that is incorrect. At some point in the semester, you'll get used to it though so it shouldn't be a huge problem. It's also sometimes kind of difficult to wrap your head around the content because almost everything is published by Gasarch, so if you're unable to understand the topic, there isn't really a supplementary textbook or resource to go through. However, Gasarch and Emily are super accessible through email, office hours, and Zoom. They are understanding regarding questions involving course content, and grading is done fast. There are no minus grades given as well, and the cutoffs are usually lowered for an A, but it changes every semester based on the difficulty (88 this semester). Compared to previous years, I would have to say that 2022 was much easier. 250H is weird due to the fact that they are certain programming assignments that are given out. These are usually pretty easy and can be done quickly considering examples are given out for the code. I do recommend using Python because Java doesn't work without certain optimizations such as needing to use imports such as BigInteger to increase number thresholds, but I did use Java (wasn't as proficient at Python) and it's just a little more work compared to using Python, so if you don't know how to use Python don't worry. All assignments are to be done through a computer as Emily and Gasarch prefer to grade LaTeX documents (which you will learn how to use LaTeX through Overleaf) compared to handwriting. Untimed midterms are pretty chill as they're 50% of the grade with about a week to do, and for each of the timed exams, we're given 2 hours and 15 minutes to do which shouldn't take you that long as they are 3 questions each. Exams are open note and are done at night at 8 PM which can be sort of inconvenient, but Gasarch is a night-owl so it's whatever. To do well in this course, make sure you find a study group and work together on homework assignments. You don't have to be incredibly smart to do well in this course, but you need to do the work, and I recommend trying to score highly on the assignments are the exams/midterms make up 65-70% of the class. Take advantage of Gasarch's dead-cat policy as he gives a two-day extension on almost every assignment, so if you have any questions after the weekend then you can ask in class before it's due. Make sure to show everything possible as tons of points can be taken off otherwise for not including simple and obvious steps as inferring without showing is not accepted. As a side note, Gasarch and Emily will bring in treats for certain occasions such as muffins for Muffin Math or chocolates just out of the blue, so that's a small bonus as well. The camaraderie is definitely one of the best parts of this class as it's very inclusive and everyone gets to know each other at a much deeper level. If you really match Gasarch's wavelength you can also end up playing certain games with him such as Dominion which was pretty cool. Overall, I highly recommend this class over regular 250, but only if you're committed to the work. You should end up getting a higher grade, significantly improve your mathematical maturity, and just learn more about discrete mathematics at a higher level."", 'rating': 5, 'expected_grade': 'A', 'created': '2022-05-31T03:11:29Z'}]",CMSC,250H,CMSC250H,Discrete Structures,4.0,"<b>Prerequisite:</b> Minimum grade of C- in CMSC131; and minimum grade of C- in MATH141.

The content that you learned in lectures barely helped for the projects. I remember being quite frustrated by the first project because I was going through slides and I didn't know how to do it. Once you realize that the projects are a lot of Googling how to use the tools they give you (such as Pandas and numpy), they become pretty easy. Even though they were easy, the projects were tedious and uninteresting, and they do take quite a bit of time. I expected more of a coding class, but you have to explain and analyze a lot of things in your project (which is I guess how data science is, but I found it uninteresting). There's only four projects, however, and the fourth one (the map one) was pretty short and interesting. The projects were graded leniently, with averages in the high 90s, but they took way too long to grade them. The midterms didn't end up being too difficult, but he had basically no practice material. It'll probably get better as time goes on since he'll just re-use old exams as practice, but I had no idea how to prepare for his midterms. Since the projects have basically nothing to do with lecture, I stopped going after the second midterm (there's no final exam, just a final project). He has you do weekly reading quizzes and they were pass/fail, so they were pretty much free points. The final project is basically what you make out of it.

Also, the vast majority of the grade comes from projects so this isn’t even a big deal\r\n\r\nLectures: Max talks about the fundamental topics briefly and doesn’t go into too much detail.

Max actually makes me want to come to lecture as opposed to feeling like I have to. I love having professors that are easy to talk to and feel more down to earth.
