class. Open note exams. One big group project.","1":"Easy class but awful professor. He is frequently absent to nonexistent on the student forum Piazza, and many questions are left unanswered or answered only affer they aren\u2019t relevant anymore (i.e. exam\/project questions after the deadline). A couple examples:\r\n\r\n1. For our midterm we were learning stuff up to the week before the exam. Porter confirmed that the exam material may include what was taught in lecture that week, but neglected to upload the slides for that material. Many students asked on the forum for the slides, frequently (13 hours before the exam, 9 hours, then 5 and then 2 hours before the exam, all on the same thread). One hour before the exam the professor finally responds saying \u201cSorry for the missing slides\u201d but still neglects to upload them\r\n\r\n2. On the Tuesday a week before Thanksgiving break Porter assigned us another lab, to be due the following Monday (2 days before break). Again, students posted on the forum asking for an extension on the lab due date as many people were traveling for break and as the lab was also longer and more difficult than any other. Once again, no response from the professor, even after over 30 people \u201cgood questioned\u201d it on Piazza. The day after, he assigned another lab due the Monday after break.\r\n\r\n3. The semester project was not brought up again until midterm season, and he waited an extra week to release the project idea bds, and then ANOTHER week to release the project signups (this wasn\u2019t intentional, he released them late), which left us about a month to start and finish a priject from scratch in addition to the weekly labs and our other classes.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, this class was a huge disappointment and made me reconsider never doing Android dev ever again. Other reviews say Porter grows bitter as more and more students stop going to class, but he also grows really unresponsive and irresponsible. He doesn\u2019t do a good job teaching; he just reads off the slides, which by themselves are just screenshots of sample code. Most of our labs we finished with a mix of stack overflow and just copying the sample code.","2":"Totally ineffective as a lecturer. He reads from the slides that are literally just text and bullet points. Lecturers are not engaging, and because the emulator on android studio is laggy and takes forever, he cannot demonstrate how apps work but instead shows you the code in fragments on his slide which are of no help.\r\n\r\nHis labs are relatively easy because they are \"fill in the blank\" style. These weekly labs were slightly annoying because they did not offer anything substantial to teach you. You could easily look up how to do something on stack overflow and it was normally a one liner. But I guess it is harder to make normal cs projects that involve making an application on android from scratch so personally I do not know what other alternative there could be.\r\n\r\nNow about the big group project: I feel this was managed horribly. The teams were not assigned until after the first midterm in mid October along with the potential project ideas to pick from if you didn't have an original one of your own. This left students 6 weeks to build an android application from scratch, while balancing weekly labs and other coursework. 6 weeks was not an adequate time frame to do a group project. You are normally a team of 6 people but thats still hard to manage during the roughest part of the semester.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to the midterm, students felt they got steam rolled. It was all short answer with a few true\/false mixed in. the average was around a 64%. Fortunately the labs and the group project will weigh more than exams in the long run. Several students who took the midterm felt railroaded but that is partially due to Porters ineffective teaching.\r\n\r\nI learned the most about android dev doing my own outside research on youtube and stack overflow and most importantly during the group project. That is where the real learning starts. I understand this class will be switching over to iOS development for handhelds but whether or not that is a permanent thing or if it will alternate from fall to spring semester from android to iOS i am not sure. If Porter is teaching 436 again don't worry. The class is not too hard and its pretty manageable to get a high passing grade. Just don't expect much from Porter. Or his incompetent TA's that never show up to office hours. In fact, it felt like both instructor and TAs just didn't give a damn this semester...","3":"Porter responds to few, if any questions asked on Piazza, and will often read off the slides instead of actually lecturing.  \r\n\r\nTAs are nonexistent on the online forum as well; many will often cancel office hours last minute, screwing over people who have questions on course content.\r\n\r\nPorter will often release the slides a few days late after lecture as well; while you can read previous semester's slides to study, this is still annoying nonetheless.\r\n\r\nI was and am extremely disappointed in this class' organization and content.  Based on the past reviews of this class and Porter, I was expecting a learning experience, not a power-point reading club.\r\n ","4":"436 was a fun class for me due to the subject matter but it was poorly run. The class was not difficult but TA's\/professors were not very responsive in Piazza and Porter gave off a vibe that he did not really care about the class that much. My biggest gripe is with the midterm and final, where no practice material or quizzes were given beforehand, and we were not given the midterm back. The class was not hard but throughout the semester it was unclear what my grade in the class was as the weekly labs were only worth 25% of my grade, and the average for the first midterm was 65%, which indicates the class should be curved (Although Porter never talked about us or assured that a curve would happen). I went into the final not knowing what 50% of my grade in the class was going to be due to the final project being graded, and a week after the final I am still unsure what my final grade is. This uncertainty and poor administration made an otherwise fun course a source of minor anxiety for me.","5":"Lectures were very boring, but projects were pretty easy. We didn't really know what was going to be on the test. Not a hard class to get a good grade in however. ","6":"I'm not sure what grade I'm expecting since this was written before the final and the final is worth 20% of our grade so I could end up with a C if I bomb it. The lectures are very boring and aren't recorded. The projects were easy; Only one of the projects took me a long time to do. This class shouldn't take too much of your time so taking it with another project heavy class should be ok. \r\n\r\nThe professor doesn't really listen to students' complaints. For example, someone asked the professor to record the lectures but he said \"no\" because he believed that people would stop coming to class and he also said recording through Panapto was difficult. Doesn't really make sense because only like maybe 20% of students come to class now and he doesn't record lectures so there isn't a difference. Project descriptions were pretty vague and TAs didn't seem to be much help. \r\n\r\nIn general, this class is more of a teach yourself type of a class. I still recommend taking it but maybe not with Keleher. ","7":"I took this course in Spring 2021.\r\nMarsh uses a flipped classroom but generally he makes everything very explicit and his lecture videos teach the material well. I would say that learning to program iOS apps with Swift is one of the most satisfying and valuable skills I gained in college.","8":"His lectures are pretty boring besides showing off a few demos. Did not want record the class and only posted slides. \r\nOverall, pretty easy class and projects are not too hard. ","9":"Awful bro. The labs are assigned over weekends, so there's no office hours til the day they're due. Porter hasn't answered a single thing on Piazza & the TAs watch the Piazza and just don't reply. I'm terrified for the midterm and final cause this class is a mess. Horribly run and not worth the stress.","10":"Please don't. The worst, I repeat, the worst CS class I've taken at UMD.\r\n\r\nUsually, 2 weekly labs worth 1% take a good amount of time\r\n\r\nIt took us 3 to 4 weeks to convince him to release the labs 1 day earlier so we could use more OH or not have the weekend fully consumed by them.\r\n\r\nRidiculously unresponsive professor\r\n\r\nAdam Porter simply does not care about students and it's questionable how a professor can get away with this\r\n\r\nI have to make follow-ups on follow-up posts in Piazza and still no response\r\n\r\nWe still don't have any grades besides the midterm (it's almost April)\r\n\r\nThe Course is outdated. Porter has tried to make it seem it's not, but he does not cover the most recent architectural models in Android properly very well at all, such as view models, etc.\r\n\r\nThey probably won't let us look at our exam results as well\r\n\r\nNo study guide whatsoever. The exam was ridiculously long. He put questions from every single lecture slides\r\n\r\nGarbage slides by the way\r\n\r\n436 is a bag of everything you hate about a 400 at UMD. Absolute waste of time, money, and effort. Honestly, just do Google Labs.","11":"Not a hard class to take, but lectures are mostly a waste of time except for the 30 mins a week he spends on answering lab questions and giving tips. The labs are manageable and most of the code is in the example repo\/slides. Otherwise, he doesn't provide much guidance and you tend to teach yourself for most of the class.\r\nOne downside, is he doesn't use ELMS at all, so you have to be checking Piazza or the class website for updates, which just add an extra layer to keeping up to date with tasks.","12":"Marsh taught the iOS version of this class when I took it and I also took 420 with him the previous semester. \r\n\r\nClass is structured like Marsh's other classes:\r\n- Projects are the majority of your grade in this class\r\n- There are exams but they are online on gradescope, open note, open internet\r\n- Class is flipped model, so lectures are prerecorded and you are expected to watch them before class. During actual lecture time, he goes over examples which may or may not be helpful.\r\n\r\nThe projects outside of the first one are graded by hand by TAs and they are pretty lenient with grading. Be fully prepared to teach yourself for this class and pray you get good TAs the semester you take it. There will be a group project to design an app, which is very open ended. My biggest complaint is with the final project. It felt very cobbled together and it was released far too late into the semester, while we had other projects to do as well.\r\n\r\nOverall, Marsh is one of the nicest, most accommodating professors in the department, but takes a while to get used to. His lectures can be very boring and 436 itself seemed to fall apart organizationally towards the end of the semester.","13":"Prof. Deshpande was a great professor (especially for computer science courses). He did not just stand in front of the class and read off a power point. He actually taught the concepts, sometimes with no presentation at all. When he did use a power point, it was as a visual aid and not as a crutch.\n\r\nFor this semester, he did only quizzes (no midterm) and a final, plus homeworks. I liked the quizzes because it removed the stress of having a big midterm, however, it required you to always be caught up in the material.","14":"Very tough class. He is a funny guy and knows his material, but expect everything to be self learning through reading the disastrously insane textbook as well as his lengthy slides.\n\r\n2 homeworks (5%), 2 SQL Assignments (10%), 1 Project (30%), 1 Midterm (22%) and Final (33%)\n\r\nThe class project involves scraping web data for a topic he chooses. Everything else is done on your own. \n\r\nMidterm and Final is extremely long and tough even for the TA to finish with the allotted time. No curve.\n\r\nIf you are the \"C\" type of CS student who puts in <=60% and expect to pass then expect to get murdered in this class. No pusssyfooting or you WILL get stomped on and tossed aside with a D or F.","15":"I agree with the previous review about him just reading off the slides. DB is a very important and useful class though. See if you can get it with another professor. Nick's tests are very hard, and because he doesn't teach much (except for reading off the slides), you will find things going rough, unless you can keep up with him by reading the book. \r\nOn the other hand, I was surprised when he covered some topics at the end of the semester and did them on the whiteboard. He was so effective, and because the guy knows his stuff really well, it  worked out great. But that like last week of classes. During rest of the semester, it was all ugly outdated slides.\r\nIf you get stuck with him, convince him to do things on the board; will make your life so much easier. \r\nBut do take this course especially if you are looking to go into the industry. Maybe look for a different professor. \r\nHe has a midterm and a final, two SQL assignments, a couple of homeworks, and a major class project, which was very hard, and we didn't have much help on the project. \r\nAlso, read the book if you are taking it with Nick. Even though he covers most topics on slides (half-heartedly), his tests are definitely from the book.","16":"Terrible class! \n\r\nHe's nice enough, but, the content is incredibly outdated, does not bother to update it, his 'slides' are just those out of the book, edited to be even more confusing, the homeworks and projects do not follow the course content closely enough, most people came out of this class not knowing ANYthing about databases, despite having done relatively well in the class. Do NOT waste your time.","17":"A lot of people say he's a douche or a jackass or w\/e, so I was a bit worried when the class first started.  In my opinion there's nothing to worry about. Yes, there are times when he gets a little impatient with people, but to me it didn't seem any more extreme than any other professor. His responses on piazza were always curt, but I feel like most professors give super short\/curt responses that could be seen as rude when it comes to written communication. \n\r\nAs far as teaching style, he's your average CS prof. Go to class, he pulls up slides and goes through them. He seemed to actually care whether or not students were understanding the material as he would stop and check often if people were keeping up. He would also encourage people  fairly often to ask questions. \n\r\nIn my case, it seemed like any of the few signs there may have been of him not enjoying teaching the class stemmed from the lack of class participation when he would encourage it (which was often) so he would be left talking at us, or there would be a dialogue between only him and a couple students. ","18":"Very nice professor, willing to work with his students. His projects earlier on in the semester aren't a joke (unless you've already studied python and django). So much stress in finishing each project, but it really hammered in the concepts for databases. I would recommend this course, but probably not to final semester seniors.","19":"Really nice and lenient grader. Exams aren't too hard","20":"Good Professor, kinda boring to listen to during lectures but the material is interesting. Willing to listen to students about concerns with the class and will actually do something to address these issues. Exams are pretty hard though, but he curves them enough.","21":"Very outdated class. My class average was a 50% and I got above that just by cramming before tests\/quizzes. The final project this semester required us to make an android app and node js server, none of which even had to implement all of the advanced things we learned. Slides are also mediocre and literally just ripped from the book. I feel like I learned all of the important stuff with one the first 5 weeks then the rest of the course was just needlessly complicated and not very useful.","22":"Pros:\r\nNice guy\r\nLenient grader\r\nListens to student's concerns\r\nEasy and fun material in the beginning \r\n\r\nCons:\r\nExtremely boring lecturer\r\nThe class material is extremely boring for the most part\r\nTowards the end of the semester the material becomes very difficult","23":"Nice professor. Didn't do the best job handling covid, but was clearly trying and cares.","24":"This class as an online course has been horrible. The homeworks are absolutely killer and take 10+ hours a week to get done, if you can even figure them out at all. They\u2019re usually 20+ questions and some programming assignment that the instructions are often unclear for. Multiple times during the homework it feels like during lecture we were taught how to do a doggy paddle and the assignment is like figure out how to swim across the Atlantic, good luck. The midterm was poorly done too, with 2 parts on elms being multiple choice and a writing section, timed. I truly feel like I haven\u2019t learned that much and the homeworks are incredibly frustrating. Lectures are not great either and we have a synchronous time every week where we meet and he just repeats what\u2019s on the slides from the videos we already watched. This class is very poorly organized and I would not recommend it to anyone due to the frustration and headache.","25":"CMSC424 during the full covid semester is actually kind of absurd. The concepts build up extremely rapidly, but the extraordinarily difficult homeworks don't even cover material relevant to future jobs. If I ever have to calculate precisely how many hard disk seeks and block reads occur when running a SQL Hybrid Hash merge join operation in the worst case at a future job, I will actually eat my hat. The fact that homeworks ask us to effectively re-derive and analyze internal sql algorithms is a bit ridiculous for this semester. \r\n\r\nI made the mistake of not doing a couple early homeworks to make room for other classes, thinking the difficulty would be consistent throughout the semester. Turns out I need every point I can get in this class, and that's not really possible with how inscrutable and impossible the homeworks have become. ","26":"The lectures are worthless, the homeworks take 10+ hours to complete and even then getting good scores on them is extremely difficult, the exam was terrible and poorly managed, and I don't think I learned a single thing this semester other than some useful surface level fragments of information","27":"First course I've ever had to withdraw from (3.9 GPA double major). Semester started off fine (SQL section was handled fairly) and veered completely off the rails into incomprehensible algorithms which were not well taught. Professor started off giving polls on certain concepts, but then didn't bother when it was really needed.\r\n\r\nHomeworks regularly required us to sift through documentation, including learning procedural SQL (not covered in class), to low-level implementations of data structures and joining algorithms in Python. If I wanted to write shitty low-level code for 10+ hrs\/wk I would have just taken Operating Systems. In addition, even though the professor gives 20 late days, the standard due date for homeworks is within 3-4 days, so it's not that big of a helping hand. I thought the HW in the later half of the course would be similar to the difficulty in the first half, and got screwed having to write those algorithms with limited time.\r\n\r\nMidterm was filled with questions on highly specific concepts that were covered once in class. Average on Part 2 of the midterm was <50%. This midterm was also supposed to be taken closed note, but on the honor system. Any student who cheated probably gained a major advantage due to the specific nature of the questions.\r\n\r\nAvoid CMSC424 online with Deshpande at all costs. This class singlehandedly made me switch out of Data Science into the Machine Learning track, and probably killed any interest I would have in Data Science at all, which was a shame since I really enjoyed CMSC320 and CMSC422.","28":"good class pogchamp\r\nvery hard - but lots of interesting material\r\nonline environment is, if anything, just as good or better than in person lecture, as is the case with most computer science courses\r\n\r\nThe coding homeworks are often straightforward, but the gradescope questions are usually relatively long. Overall not too bad of a class. The exams are hard, but everyone does terribly, and the grading is extremely flexible.","29":"It's a good course but I don't know if its transition to online has been best. As many other reviewers have noted, there's a definite disconnect between the lecture\/slides\/textbook and the homework at times. Most coding assignments are fairly easy, but worksheets can be very vague and often require office hours for clarification. Projects\/worksheets take up about 75% of your overall grade and there is probably a minimum of a solid 8 hours of homework each week. It seems like the curve will be fairly generous and I believe this class is pretty hard to fail, but it's also far from a piece of cake.\r\n\r\nAlso, there's simply way too much material involved in this course. You jump from topic to topic week after week while it feels like you're really just skimming the surface.","30":"I believe this class is necessary for all computer science majors to take because it gives you an in depth overview about databases and the theories\/concepts behind them. However, the real world will probably cover 20% of what you actually learn. Since it was the covid online semester, I appreciate Amol for having a synchronous call once a week to cover the panoptos for the week, but if you didn't watch the videos or have any questions the lecture is useless. There was a homework worksheet on gradescope and mini coding project due every week which did seem tough to finish at times (especially at the end of the semester) but he was lenient and gave us 20 late days for the whole semester while dropping some assignments. The midterms were very hard and the averages of them were on the low side, but the curve was extremely generous (80% is an A). He is responsive to concerns and was one of the more understanding CS professors that I have had. The only comment that I have is that there are so many topics that you feel you are zooming without really learning it in depth. But it is kinda impossible to fail this class since the curve is generous and if you show effort within each assignment, you are guaranteed to pass.","31":"I took this class when it was online during covid. It was a terrible format for the insane amount of information they expected to teach. The pre-recorded lectures were decent (towards the end it started getting to be too much), but the once a week live classes were just simplified re-iterations of the pre-recorded lectures and did not add much value except for the few classes the professor created polls to practice application of the material.\r\n\r\nThe professor tried to answer questions during class but often ran out of time because he was spending most of the time re-iterating the material. There was no clear guidance to use the textbook, but sometimes he would answer a student question by just saying to read the textbook.\r\n\r\nHomeworks were way too long and sometimes vague in expectations. Exams were also too long to finish for the average person. There was an overall curve at the end that helped take into account the difficulty and effort required to complete all the assignments.\r\n\r\nI think a lot of the material in the class is useful to know, but since there is SO much information, it's hard to take all of it in and pick out which specific things you should know for homeworks or exams. A good word to describe this class is \"overwhelming,\" but if you're prepared to consume an insane amount of information (with a decent amount of self study), then you could get a lot out of this class.","32":"This is a good class overall, especially in an online setting. The content is definitely relevant and need-to-know, and Keleher is a good and straightforward lecturer - doesn't meander or BS around at all. Some might consider him too curt but I honestly prefer that to a professor that's distracting or all over the place. \r\nSlides are good, although I wish he could post slides before lecture and also record them, but that's mainly to give us incentive to show up to class. \r\nProjects aren't too bad, we have a week to do each and each are worth a good chunk of the grade. Speaking of which, I'm glad that the grade distribution for this class is balanced, so that no one assignment \/ exam is worth an insane amount (looking at you 351). Exams and quizzes are also fair. \r\nOverall, I'd recommend taking this class with Pete if you can. ","33":"Mediocre prof. Reads of the PowerPoint rather than teaching. Posts quizzes and makes them due before he actually teaches the material. Refuses to post lecture recordings. Projects aren't bad. Very vague on information relating to exams. Pushes students to participate.","34":"Other than this class being useless, Peter is an awful teacher.  He doesn't record lectures, reads off of slides, and seems to have no passion for teaching the material.  Avoid if you can.","35":"Not a great experience. I took the course while it was online and it was harder for unnecessary reasons. Keleher refused to upload lecture recordings to us so we only had the book and slides. His reasoning being we should be reading the textbook in advance and come to class for clarification, but he never told us the chapters we should be reading. On top of that he was giving us quizzes on material he hadn't taught yet. He justified it by saying that he offered a total of 20 late days for assignments, but that point is kind of moot when you have a hard enough time preparing yourself","36":"Mediocore professor. The lecture and slides are somehow vague and disorganized. But do cares about students' needs. ","37":"I did well in his class but I basically self taught the entire curriculum. The textbook is your friend if you can't get anything from the lectures. He wouldn't upload lecture recordings which I found quite annoying, and spending so much extra time reading the textbook for quizzes on material we didn't even learn in class yet was also quite annoying. The late days, exams, and assignments were fair but the assignments sometimes had vague descriptions. Overall, if you want to take CMSC424 and you have to take it with Peter, do it. I wouldn't avoid him for the sake of avoiding him, but don't expect it to be the best class....","38":"Worst professor I've had at umd. His lectures are boring and useless. He doesn't even upload them and refuses to send them to anyone even if they were sick (although he records them!). His quizzes are due at noon (before lecture) and the material on the quiz is taught after the quiz's deadline (in lecture). He doesn't care about his students and only answers piazza questions selectively. He does not respond to emails and does not make ANY sort of accommodations\/exceptions to help his students. Even though I did well in the class, I genuinely believe that he wants students to fail and doesn't give a f**** about them. Do NOT take him for any class!","39":"He's an average professor, but the class was pretty good overall. We had weekly quizzes and project assignments, and we had three exams (no final). The lectures were kinda boring, but the lecture slides were useful and a good resource for studying for exams. The most annoying thing about the class is that the quizzes were based on content that we didn't learn yet, which meant that we had to learn topics ourselves using the textbook. I still think overall the class and the coursework was pretty fair, and the class isn't any better or worse than other 400 level cs classes.","40":"Do not take this professor. If he is the only one available, take the class next semester. Boring lectures, which he recorded but refused to share with anyone. His quizzes tested us on material that had not been taught yet. Also, he is the most difficult person to communicate with. He will only answer piazza posts if he feels like it and his answers will be at most a few words. You have a follow-up question to his 4-word answer? Good luck getting another response. In the syllabus, he says to email him if he does not respond on piazza. I sent him at least 4 emails this semester and he didn't respond to any of them. He really doesn't care about his students and he definitely wasn't there for them during this difficult online semester.","41":"I don't think Pete is as bad as some of the reviews below state. First, I will say yes, he is not responsive on Piazza, and him not releasing recorded lectures is annoying, along with his refusal to post the slides beforehand. Some quizzes were hard, and he could have released answers sooner to some. The query optimizing part of the class was needlessly difficult and not very useful.\r\nHowever, I thought his lectures were ok- I've definitely seen waaaay worse. His exams were quite easy, with high averages, and were a lot like the quizzes. No final, too, which is a big relief. Projects were also reasonable, and I appreciate that they were worth a lot of the grade. Considering that other classes like CMSC351 and CMSC451 place an undue grade emphasis like 2 exams, this is a major relief. He also gave a total of 20 late days across all assignments, no penalties, which is also great. The content is also very useful to learn, especially in the first half. Like a review below said, if you plan on taking CMSC424 and see Pete is teaching it, you should be fine with him.","42":"Absolute garbage professor. He gives out work without even teaching the material. Additionally, he has no respect for student concerns about taking an exam in person while Omricon is raging through the United States. Gave out assignments where majority of the time to work on it was during the Thanksgiving break. Would not take class with him. ","43":"I would give 0 star if I could. The lecture slides are basically 100+ pages table of content with excessive amount of useless information. The exams are insanely long and difficult given only 60 minutes. His lecture is just hard to understand and he doesn't explain things well. Worst class I've ever taken at UMD.","44":"He is a very good and fair professor. He genuinely cares. CMSC424 could use some improvements - such as better coverage of the theory assessed on the exams. Most of the topics are covered well but the exams can be quite tricky. Projects are fair and even fun at times. I took the course hoping to be better prepared for industry since I lacked database experience. For me ~60% seems immediately useful and the remaining ~40% was some cool-to-know theory and some challenges\/issues in the space. Others may not be happy with this ratio or they may perceive a different ratio. I enjoyed the class. I'd give it a 4, but I am giving it a 5 because it is  definitely better than 2.93 it currently stands at.","45":"Not a good class at all. The lectures were very dry. I get it, databases aren't the most exciting topic in the world. But I just found it hard to retain anything from the lectures in this class. It's a very, very good thing that all the exams ended up being online, because I needed my notes and the slides as a reference. I just finished the final exam and there was so much stuff that I remember him talking about in class, but I couldn't remember any of the details of. Deshpande just doesn't seem to be very good at teaching. I don't think he got the concepts across very well at all.\r\n\r\nAnd man, this class is actually really hard! The projects will eat up tons of your time. The exams are really, really hard. Even the weekly quizzes were pretty challenging. The upside is that there's a very, very, very generous curve. No matter what, a 60 is the minimum grade to pass this class. That cutoff can be lowered, but never raised. So there is plenty of leniency. This class actually reminds me of 351 in a few ways. 424 focuses a lot on theory at times, much like 351. 351 is extraordinarily hard, but there's always a very generous curve at the end. This class is the same way.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that the SQL skills learned in this class will be helpful. But this class is so much more than SQL, and I kind of mean that in a bad way. There's relational algebra and functional dependencies, E\/R modeling, database implementation, then NoSQL stuff, and finally transactions. That's a vast array of topics, and they're done in a strange order, too. This class needs to be whittled down a lot. Focus much more on the SQL and NoSQL stuff. Then at the end, focus on database implementation. Cut out all the theory. Basically, what I'm saying is, this class covers a lot of useful information, but it also covers a lot of useless information. And under Deshpande, I think it's taught poorly. If I even got a 50% on this final, I'll be lucky. I'm just glad the cutoffs are so generous that I could afford to get a 10% on the final and still pass.","46":"good guy, but not the best at teaching\/running a course. all the projects were rather difficult and required you to do a lot of learning outside of class to figure them out. on the bright side, no secret tests. the midterms and final were extremely long and difficult, but he heavily curves (A- is about an 80) to make up for it. giving him 3 stars because he does seem to care about his students learning, just doesn't seem the best at it","47":"Amol is a nice guy and generally means well, but this class has a lot of issues.\r\n\r\n1. Assignments - In Fall 2021 we had 6 assignments (2 written, 4 programming). While they are somewhat helpful in understanding the material, their length makes them really time consuming (more than expected for a 400 level class). For example, I remember writing 20 or so SQL queries where 10 would have been perfectly sufficient, and in general the written assignments were really long. They aren't necessarily difficult, but you definitely have to start early. One nice thing that I really appreciated was that Amol gives you 10 free late days (up to 5 on a single assignment). \r\n\r\n2. Exams - The exams are quite difficult, not in terms of content but more so in terms of time. If you had 24 hours to complete it, you could probably get 80+ assuming you understood the material. But with the time constraint, it was definitely very hard to complete all of the questions fully (the averages on the exam were around 60%). One good thing is that Amol puts a fat curve on the class. He didn't disclose the official cutoffs, but in the beginning of the semester he said that an 80% would be an A (i think it ended up being a few points lower). \r\n\r\n3. Content - This is probably my biggest gripe with the class. Amol tries to cover at least 2 semesters worth of content in this class. As a result, he moves extremely fast and tends to not explain things as fully as he can. For in depth explanations, he just tells you to read the textbook (which is decent). The content starts off at a decent pace, but after midterm 1 really picks up. I didn't feel like I was able to absorb anything meaningful because I was so focused on just cramming all of this information into my head to study. I also think that a lot of the content can be changed. We spend a lot of time learning about specific operations on disk, even though Amol prefaces the unit saying \"no systems actually do it this way anymore.\" He justifies it saying that this is still the foundation, but I personally found it very discouraging. \r\n\r\n4. Campuswire - This is maybe more of a personal issue, but Amol insists on using campuswire instead of piazza. I really hate campuswire (and I think the majority of the class did too). I find it harder to search posts, and you can't follow questions for when they've been answered.\r\n\r\nIn general, databases is a pretty dry subject so I don't blame Amol for the class being generally boring. One thing I really liked was that he was very responsive so you generally got a fast response to questions on campuswire. He did also listen to students' COVID concerns and had exams online (along with recorded lecture). There's definitely improvements to be made, so unless you are very interested in databases or need the class for a major requirement, I would avoid this class for now. \r\n","48":"He gets a lot of hate but I don't fully understand why. His exams are difficult but he clearly cares about the students wellbeing by moving our midterms and finals online due to students fearing about COVID. He also frequently takes questions during lectures, which is not something other CS professors normally do. The projects in this class are quite tedious (especially project 4 and its lack of documentation), but overall he's a really nice guy, explains things well (at least for me), and has a really flexible late day policy.","49":"I took the course during Fall 2021.\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue with the class was his teaching style. He would just plow through his slides which were pretty much just copy and paste from the textbook, but he wouldn't explain the content on the slides well. He would pretty much just end up reading it straight from the slides and then assume that we know exactly what it means, while on most slides there was always something he could explain more. This made the class really difficult when it came to exam time. There could be a question that was somewhat similar to the slides, and many students would still have no clue how to do it, which is a big issue. When you go to office hours, there have been multiple times where I've asked the different TAs the same question and have gotten a different answer, which made things even harder to understand.\r\n\r\nThe assignments were actually not too hard, just takes a lot of time, so you really have to set time to really work on it. Just getting a project set up could take 2-3 hours if your unlucky. Usually though, they are doable and you can get 90+ on all of them. \r\n\r\nWhile the teaching style was bad, you could get a 50-70 on every exam and midterm and still end up with a B\/B+, so it ends not being the worst class. You do end up learning SQL, Spark, MongoDB, and important relational database concepts in the class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","50":"Amazing course. Learnt a lot about databases and the projects were fun to code. He is a good person and a great lecturer. He and his TAs are very responsive to questions after class on CampusWire which was a godsend because database environments and coding lead to a lot of questions. They also have a strong grip on the material and I got all my queries resolved. Highly recommend the class. One of the best ones that I have taken at UMD.","51":"I took this course in Spring 2022\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n+ He really got his act together for the final, after one of the most disastrous midterms I have ever taken. He gave an exact topic breakdown of each question on the final to ensure you knew what was coming.\r\n+ All topics on the first midterm were taught and covered really well. \r\n+ The projects from this part of the course were also really manageable and conveyed the topics taught well.\r\n+ The first midterm as a whole was very fair and manageable\r\n+ Late day policy is extremely generous: 20 no penalty late days shared across all assignments\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Everything after the first midterm went to complete shit. Lectures suddenly became extremely dry, and it was hard to know what concepts to focus on and would become important later. Much less people stopped coming.\r\n- Topics in this part of the class were significantly more lower level and seemed to have less relevance to what you might be asked to do in real life\r\n- The second midterm went poorly as a result of this, with no one knowing how to answer the questions or having a good grasp on the topics\r\n- Projects in the later half of the course were exclusively instructor written but had almost no documentation. Since they were in Python, it was impossible to know what each function was asking for and was returning. This made coding the projects nigh impossible\r\n- Oftentimes, concepts were taught AFTER the weekly quiz corresponding to that topic was due, with the idea being you would use a late day. While the late day policy is generous, it contributed to an environment that encouraged hard quizzes, with the expectation that you would simply turn it in late after lecture","52":"This is THE worst structured course I have ever taken, which has not been helped by Amol's lectures not being useful, mostly just reading off of extremely long slide decks. Despite their size, the slides provide only minimal information to complete weekly homework and projects, so we are expected (explicitly) to read up on the programming language manuals for examples and syntax. The project descriptions are extremely vague and full of typos, with him usually updating them multiple times after releasing it. Sometimes the project descriptions contradict to examples we have gone over in class, making it all very confusing. \r\n\r\nThe class schedule is also a disaster. We will have homework due the day before exams, with a full project due only days after. On the topic of exams, he has put material on an exam that we had not learned until THE LECTURE BEFORE, with no opportunity to practice concepts on homework\/projects. There were no explicit topic lists released for exams, usually having to be put together by scouring many piazza posts. The exams he released as practice did not accurately reflect the topics on the exam due to him re-organizing the syllabus, but he couldn't even be bothered to write an accurate practice exam. \r\n\r\nThe class has entirely too much content, trying to jam in at least 2 semesters of content, a lot of which is theory with no practical examples of why it is useful. \r\nI would not recommend taking this course under any circumstances. If you want to learn SQL, you are better off teaching yourself than subjecting yourself to this misery.","53":"A good instructor. Grades lightly. If you are a CS major or an InfoSci major, this is the one credit elective with less workload you are looking for! ","54":"Nelson is a wonderfully funny professor who really values his students. I would certainly recommend that you take him, if possible, because he makes his classes very enjoyable. His exams can be fairly tricky, but if you study well you will be fine.","55":"In my opinion, Nelson is a solid CS professor. I took 216 with him, and he made it a point to ensure us that it wasn't a weeder course. \n\r\nOnce you get around the accent, he's great at explaining the topics at hand. He keeps his lectures fairly lighthearted and relaxed, and he also has a sense of humor. He, along with his TAs, are stationed on Piazza to help students with any problems or concerns, and this is very convenient and helpful. \n\r\nProjects take longer to complete than those in 131 and 132, and starting early is essential. Quizzes and Exams are fair, and he provides a test bank from previous semesters. The final was challenging, so be prepared. \n\r\nRegarding the cons of a class with Nelson - he can be very annoying. The amount of times he will stop the lecture just to call out a student fooling around is just unnecessary and it also distracts everyone in the class. His humor also doesn't appeal to everyone. In addition, be prepared for your inbox to be flooded with his email updates on the course material. I once remember receiving six emails in a 15 minute span from him alone.\n\r\nOverall, he's a great CS prof, and the only professor I would take over him is Fawzi Emad.  ","56":"Here's the thing with Nelson: he's a great guy and fun to be around, but sometimes that gets in the way of his teaching. He jokes a lot, which makes lecture interesting, but I feel as if I could've gotten a lot more out of 216 with someone else. His projects and quizzes are fair. The tests are fair too, although he likes to test very nit-picky, minor details that any normal person would just test out in a dummy program rather than memorize.","57":"I think he is an amazing professor. He is a pretty decent lecturer, but I think what makes him stand out is how receptive he is to student concerns. Every decision he makes is meant to help us succeed and have a better understanding of the material.","58":"He's a pretty good professor.\n\r\nHis lectures are extremely boring and he sticks unfunny jokes in them, but all of the slides and recordings of his lectures were available online. I needed to start my projects right away because the last half of them were given back-to-back with little time to work on them and I couldn't get any help from TAs. If enough students were confused about some part of an assignment, he would explain it in detail during lectures, but individualized assistance was hard to find. He never gave any of the pop quizzes he threatened to give, but if he says that something will be on a test or quiz, it will be.","59":"Nelson's class was very disappointing.  The first half was challenging and interesting.  The second half died for me.  The projects were super simplistic but overly complicated with external obfuscation\/unclear specification.  He seemed to claim this was some kind of test of character or professional challenge.  But it just made the last 1\/3 of the course into a technically inadequate, stressful game.\n\r\nHe is funny but that's not why I'm in school.  Nor am I in school to be stressed and have my character tested.  There were way too many cheaters, collaborators and brown-nosers who had their strategies for getting their projects done, and they really benefitted in the second half of the course during the b.s. projects.  The students who were doing their own work were then at a disadvantage.  Meanwhile the technical quality of the material covered during that last 1\/3 was very low.\n\r\ni'd rather have a less engaging, entertaining teacher and get a good education throughout the entire class.","60":"Great professor , absolutely hilarious. Very fair in terms of exams , quizzes , and projects. You can find everything in his lectureExamples if you are confused on any topic. Would highly recommend, best teacher i've so far in CS.","61":"I don't know about others. But I would definitely not recommend him to my friends. He teaches really fast and he just seems to be too smart to explain much things. May 216 is a very hard class but honestly I don't think Neil Spring did a good job lecturing. \r\nI got both A's in CMSC131 and CMSC132; but I found following Neil Spring in lecture very hard. I might do better in other professor's class. Reading books at home or going to TA's are a lot more helpful than sitting in his lecture and feeling awful for not following. \r\nThe worst part is, I don't even know what is it that I don't understand. \r\nChallenge yourself if you think you are a pretty smart guy and have experience with C and linux before. \r\nGood luck! ","62":"Neil is the best teacher I've had at UMD.\n\r\nI'll preface the rest of this by saying that I'm a pretty competent programmer, and pick up CS-related information quite quickly.  For students like myself, Neil is the ideal professor.  He really knows his stuff, and likes to do a lot of his teaching by working through code examples (he doesn't like the slideshows).\n\r\nFor those that aren't as familiar with the course content, I can see Neil getting a bit confusing.  His way of jumping around on the terminal and in vi might be a bit to take in at first, but I think it gets easier as the semester goes on.","63":"Lecture:\r\nI honestly don't know how we are supposed to learn from a compsci lecture. Instead of paying attention during class I would just go through Dr. Spring's lecture file and if I was going at the same pace as him I could ask questions. Otherwise I would just figure things out by myself. It was nice that he allowed laptops during lecture. If you want to keep up with Spring during lecture you either have to be a genius, already know C really well, or study the lecture slides the night before (Note: Spring doesn't use lecture slides, but we had access to Nelson's lecture slides.) \n\r\nDiscussion:\r\nWas somewhat useful I guess. We had about five quizzes and two unannounced graded lab projects. The quizzes and lab projects were fairly easy. If we didn't have a project or quiz the TA would go over something useful for the current project. \n\r\nProjects:\r\nRange of difficulty on the projects. We had six projects and the most difficult one was probably the Shell project (#5 for my class). I was lazy about testing and would fail a couple of secret tests on the projects. The secret tests are much more in depth than they were in CMSC132. \n\r\nAssembly:\r\nThis class is on C and Assembly. I thought Assembly was fun and not that hard. If you are one of those people that rely on compilation and debugging to see if your code works you are going to have a hard time with assembly. My advice is just to go slow and keep very careful track of the registers. Debugging in Assembly is very hard, so your goal is to not have to debug. For our assembly project I wrote 2\/3 files perfectly on the first try because I was VERY careful and coded very slowly. \n\r\nTests:\r\nThe first exam and the final were very hard multiple-multiple choice questions (like circle all correct answers, not just circle one letter). I think they made the 2nd and 3rd exam a little easier to account for the fact that the average on the first exam was like a 60%. They liked to make you code parts of the project on the exams to make sure you knew what you were doing on the project and that you weren't just guessing on the project. \n\r\nLast Remarks:\r\nI didn't treat this class with enough respect, which is why I got an A-. I didn't really study for the first exam and got a 63%. Studying before lecture (even just for 20 minutes) would have been very helpful.","64":"Very un-engaging lecturer. Lots of self-studying required.\n\r\nTests and quizzes are nit-picky and unexpectedly difficult, and grading can be inconsistent and unfair at times.\n\r\nProjects are too time-consuming, changed at the last minute a lot of the times, and graded in a way so as to maximize the points you lose.  \n\r\nDoesn't grade in a timely manner at all. Focuses too much on just insisting everyone stick to his banal policies and strict expectations.\n\r\nUnapproachable and abrasive at times.","65":"DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN.\r\nDisclaimer: I understand that many like his style; he's very clear on course expectations, covers almost all content in class, and is a good programmer, conveying concepts clearly and effectively. \r\nSTILL: He's boring. Beyond monotonous and un-engaging. I know that sounds like a me problem, but it's nigh impossible to focus on him for the whole 90-ish minutes, and so many times the tested material is in the small details of what he says, or the tools\/materials he explains briefly - and then you find yourself playing catchup. \r\nAlso - always changing project requirements, sometimes to the last day or so. He jokes that this is the only class you should worry about in your semester, but it's painfully true - projects are a pain in the ass if you don't start right away and know what you're doing each time. \r\nTests are a little unfair - practice material either isn't sufficient or doesn't reflect the difficulty of quizzes, etc. \r\nUnapproachable AF.\r\nLots of self-studying is required despite his teaching style. \r\nThis semester they added a lot of material, and so he just kind of charged onwards, covering all these complex threading, library function, etc. concepts and making them a significant portion of the final.\r\nDon't expect any grade-related leniency, or leniency in general beyond one excused absence. ","66":"Herman is NOT my kind of professor. He is too by the book, uptight and relies on you to learn the material by reading a text book (again not my style). Personality wise he is a great guy. I would like to work WITH him some day but I have no intentions of taking him for a CS course again. His projects were fairly simple. I finished them well before they were due all the time, he always has the best TA's as well. His quizzes and exams are designed to trick you (a methodology I do not advocate) and his lectures tend to be a little dry. He uses the slides like a script. I am relying heavily on the curve just to make it out of his class. Take that for what it's worth. ","67":"He's awesome, but his timing of assignments often left the class scrambling to get things done. \n\r\nIf you can figure out how he runs his class and writes his tests, then you're good.\n\r\nWork hard and you'll do fine","68":"Two semesters ago I took CMSC 132 with Larry Herman. I hated it. Every word that came out of his mouth filled me with aggravation and contempt. I thought he was an egotistical, straight edged jerk not to mention being completely boring and seemingly condescending to students. I was dreading the previous semester knowing that he was the only teacher for CMSC 216.\n\r\n As every other reviewer has mentioned he does in fact take attendance, force people to sit in the front, prohibit electronic devices during lecture, etc. He will also ask the trickiest, exception-to-the-rule questions on tests that are generally the difference between an A and a B. \n\r\nSome of the projects can also take a pretty good amount of time and probably average to about 20 hours or so but can be done in a lot less time with good planning\/understanding. However, if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, he tends to not include some of the key details on his slides so you will not be able to get a lot of the practical information unless you are regularly attending lecture even though he says that the \u201clecture notes will be posted on line so you don\u2019t need to take notes\u201d which most students mistakenly interpret as \u201cyou don\u2019t need to come to class\u201d. \n\r\nYet as the semester went on I slowly came to the realization that he was actually doing almost all of these things to the benefit of the students. \n\r\nAs was noted in a reviewer below me noted, the no-electronic policy forces you to pay attention with the exception of an occasional text. \n\r\nPreventing students from sitting in the back gets them closer to the material and allows him to police for devices better. \n\r\nHis stringency on the honesty policy is annoying on face value, but definitely one of the most annoying things are when people who have no understanding of material get credit for things other people came up with, so his strictness could be out of respect for the students that are actually doing their own work. \n\r\nHis attendance taking is also not in the grading policy, so lack of attendance will not directly affect your grade. He claims to use it simply as a statistical study on the grades earned versus attendance, but I also suspect that he uses it for curving. For example, he will be much more likely to curve up a grade from a B+ to at least and A- if he sees that they have attended almost every lecture. \n\r\nAlmost any time a good portion of the class is in jeopardy of missing the project deadline, he will extend it even though if the whole class wouldn\u2019t have been remiss in their responsibilities as students and started even a few days earlier they would have been fine. He always assigns them with ample time in the first place. Ample.\n\r\nAlso, early in the semester I discovered that I had a scheduling conflict with the final exam and he said that it wasn\u2019t a problem and let me take it with three other people at a later date. \n\r\nI also missed a quiz and hadn\u2019t notified him or the TA until the day of and he still allowed the zero to be replaced with the average of my other quiz grades.\n\r\nConcerning the lecture material, he is good. He is always well prepared and he always drills the important parts that you need to remember. Always. Drills. Knowing these drilled points should secure you a B in the class. \n\r\nTo achieve an A in the class, Larry expects a mastery of the subject material. He expects an A to signify Excellence, unlike other classes where A stands for Average and anything below that stands for Stupid.\n\r\nTherefore, Larry is a great teacher. Anyone who argues otherwise is either too stupid to get the grade they want, or too arrogant to put in the work he requires. In short, if you are smart and willing to work, you will like him and you will do well. Or even if you don\u2019t like him, you will at least respect him, and he will do the same for you. No question about it.\n","69":"Despite what other reviews here say, I Larry Herman is one of the best teacher I've had in the CS major.\n\r\nIt's fair to say that Larry can be strict and \"by the book\". He does forbid electronic devices during his lecture, doesn't allow students to sit in the back, and taking attendance at every lecture. If you're looking for a class to sleepwalk through, you aren't going to do well under Larry. He fully intends to educate you, whether you like it or not.\n\r\nFor those who put in the effort, Larry will \"go the extra mile\" (his words) for making sure you understand the content. This desire to help students took the form of extensions on half of the projects this semester as well as providing extra TA office hours as project deadlines approached. Both in lecture and office hours, Larry could be extremely friendly (not to mention downright funny). Throughout his lectures, Larry also made it clear where he was going with the content. One never failed to understand why he was illustrating a topic.\n\r\nCMSC216 can be a difficult course. However, Larry makes it seem a lot easier. It was a pleasure to take the course with him. I wish he was teaching CMSC330 this fall.","70":"STAY MILES AWAY FROM HIM. It doesn't matter how smart you are. You will get stupid points taken off because he is so nit-picky. He is the most unfair professor I have ever seen. He is so disorganized and doesn't keep his word about anything. He is the devil. I wish I could give him zero stars.","71":"DO NO GLOSS OVER THIS REVIEW BECAUSE IT'S LONG!  I've been right where a lot of you are right now.  I'm sure there are a lot of you reading this review to see if \"Mr. Herman\" (don't call him Dr or Professor) isn't terrible and you can suffer through his class.  The answer is no.  Look there are some cases where Larry has shown some compassion to individuals, but I haven't witnessed it.  I've had him for both 216 and 330 and both classes were made more difficult just for the sake of being difficult.  Project descriptions will range from about 10 to 15 pages that is mostly filler that will take you over an hour to sift through.  Somehow, the descriptions still end up being vague and don't bother emailing him or asking on piazza.  Instead of just giving you a simple yes or no for what is usually a simple question, you will most likely be told to look somewhere in the project description that doesn't help you, or give you an answer that is completely vague.  He's just a stereotypical awkward computer science professor that's liked by some stereotypically awkward computer science kids.  Some of his exam questions will focus on a topic from lecture that was covered on a single slide for five minutes in lecture.  All that most of us should be trying to take from these programming classes are better programming skills.  We shouldn't give two s#!t$ about some of the obscure topics that his exams can and will likely focus on.  Don't expect to get any grades back for months and you may not until the end of the semester.  Most likely I'm going to get a high B in his 330 class and I got the same in his 216 class the previous semester.  I'm not bashing him because I'm going to get a bad grade.  I'm not even bashing him because he's a terrible lecturer.  I'm writing this because he should never be put in charge of a class.  He can lecture fine but he is terrible in regards to every other aspect of being a professor.  Anyone that says otherwise is kidding themselves.  To sum this up with a simple comment:  DON'T TAKE HERMAN!  WAIT A SEMESTER TO TAKE THE CLASS!","72":"Larry Herman is a very kind-hearted guy, as much as you think otherwise.  The poor guy shattered his vertebrae last semester (for those who had him for CMSC216 Spring2012) and missed the first 3 weeks of class.  He might have been a bit cross last semester, but that would be due to all that stuff he was under (medicines, etc.).  I tore my ACL this semester, and I have him for CMSC330, and he was more than understanding of my plight, allowing me generous extensions on almost all the assignments that I turned in.  I hated to try to push the deadlines for him, but there were times I had to.  However, he is a wonderful teacher, and will answer your questions during the lecture at a specific time.  When you ask a question and he says \"We'll get to that\", mark my words, he will \"get to that\".  And far from being a douche or a dick, as many comments here described, Herman is doing his job as a low-level CS Professor, being harsh on the kids who are in the weed-out classes, those who think Computer Science is something easy you can BS your way through.  I highly recommend this professor for future classes.","73":"Herman is a fine instructor.  Not great, but far from the terrible instructor that some of the reviewers suggest he is.\n\r\nHe did a good job teaching CMSC216 and didn't really rely on the slides.  He doesn't get 5 stars because he's somewhat boring and can act a little harsh at times.","74":"I had him last year for a class and did poorly, and back then I would have given him one or two stars.. this semester though, he seems to have improved a lot. \n\r\nHe definitely intelligent, and knows the coursework and material really well. He often asks questions and encourages students to participate, and his lectures are a lot more entertaining now than they were back then. \n\r\nHowever, he can be dickish and may be hard to approach, but he's far from the \"useless lecher\" that the other reviews make him out to be. \n\r\nThings to remember: \r\n1) if you go in there expecting to hate the class because he's cocky, monotone, etc, you've pretty much just made a self-fulfilling prophecy.\r\n2) he's not the \"best teacher ever\", but he's really far from the worst. \r\n3) Call him MISTER Herman. He is not a professor, and he is not a doctor. He gets surprisingly touchy about this. ","75":"I thought that Jan was a good professor who did an excellent job explaining confusing concepts in Lecture.  All lecture slides are available online, and she also posts many coding examples that make life a lot easier when it comes to doing the projects and studying for the exams.  In office hours she is friendly and willing to help.  \r\nThe class definitely is a lot of work, but just avoid procrastinating and you should do fine.  For many of the projects extra credit is offered if you pass all of the public tests by a certain day, so definitely start early and take advantage of this option. There were also office hours from 10-6 every weekday, so if you are stuck on project just go to the TAs and they will usually clear up the problem for you.","76":"Jan is a very nice and knowledgeable professor. Because of the nature of the course, she has to cover a lot of material in a short amount of time so blanking out for even a minute will leave you lost for the rest of lecture.\n\r\nShe's not one to care if you're messing around on the internet during lecture (as long as you're not disruptive to the rest of the class) but I highly suggest you pay attention. One of the most efficient ways to study for this class is to attend and understand the lectures - and this is only a quarter of the work.\n\r\nThis class is curved around an average of 75, despite what she might say about only ever curving 2-3% ... this is a lie.\n\r\nQuizzes - She says \"you are always to expect a quiz in discussion\" but she really only gives them about once a week or every 10 days. The topics are never announced but you can bet that it will be on slides covered about 2-3 lectures ago. If you use those topics as a guide and prod around, Jan can't lie, so I suggest you straight up ask her if, say the quiz will have 'Assembly' coding on it. If she says 'maybe', or does a slight nod, it's probably a yes. Use your best judgement.\n\r\nLabs - you can tell that no one put any effort into these as my labs were titled with the previous semester with the wrong directory name. We spend the first third of the class trying to locate the file, the 2nd third trying to figure out what the directions were asking and the rest trying to follow the confusing instructions. Put out your best effort and hopefully your grader isn't a dick and gives you a 2\/2. Highly suggest consulting the people around you.\n\r\nProjects - start early. Try to talk to Jan\/TA(\/friends). Use Piazza. They are hard and you never know what the Secret Tests are looking for. If you think you're done, you're not done yet.\n\r\nExams\/Final - You'll be able to pick up clues on what's to be test in lecture and if your TA is nice, in discussion. Give yourself code to write and run them on your computer before you have to spit it out on paper. If you've had to do it on a project, expect to do a simplified and different version on an exam\/final.\n\r\nTA - possibly one of the worst TAs I've ever had. Thought he was too smart for anyone else and just sat in the front of the class not answering any questions. Complained about now being paid enough ... -__-\n\n\n\r\nOverall, if you're not a CS genius, work your ass off if you expect to even pass.","77":"Alright, so this class is gonna suck, regardless of who you chose for 216. 216 is a fast-paced course by nature and on the way you'll likely be learning two new languages - C and assembly. If you barely passed 131\/132 or had trouble on some of the assignments I HIGHLY recommend you work on projects early. These are not the kinds of projects you just sit down and burn through in a few hours like in 132, and I took the honors version.\n\r\nAnyways, Plane is a decent 216 professor, she uses the same slides as all of the other professors use and she remains fairly engaging at 9 in the morning, so that's good. She does a good deal of coding examples in lecture which helps you understand topics. I would recommend you go to lecture and work a bit on your projects while she teaches, and pay attention during the more important bits of the lecture.\n\r\nThere are six projects in this class, each with about two weeks to do. The spec for each one is drawn out and boring to read, but make sure you do, as there are a lot of hidden tricks and requirements hidden in the text. Gone are the days of private tests - 10 percent of your grade is public tests, and 75 is secret tests. You don't get to see what your project grade is when you submit - you wait a week and you get a magic score. Again, start these early. If you finish early, great, you can relax for a week and you are prepared for the quizzes. Again, this is NOT like 132. Secret tests often test a bunch of odd things (malformed input, large sample size, etc) and since you can't see the results until it is graded you can't just spam submits like in 132 until you get that perfect submission.\n\r\nQuizzes are slightly tough. If you haven't started the project most likely the material on the quiz will be brand new to you, and considering you are given 15 minutes to do a few concept questions and a programming assignment, you need to know the subject matter going into the quiz.\n\r\nLabs are the same as quizzes - if you have started the project, you should know what you are doing because the labs are a derivative of the project material of stuff that has gone on in lecture.\n\r\nTests are fairly hard, alot of programming questions, and the graders seem to love taking points off on things like syntax (I always found that rather stupid - a compiler will catch syntax errors, not logic errors). All you really need to do is look over all of the slides (posted online) before each test and refresh yourself. If you do well on the quizzes, labs, and projects up to the test, you should do fine.\n\r\nI learned so much from this class - and that's because the class moves insanely fast. You'll be doing C projects while learning assembly, then going back to learning C and doing assembly projects. If you are not up to date with the latest 131 and 132 concepts (recursion, structures, blah blah) you will get your ass handed to you in this class. I aced 132H and this class was much more time-intensive.","78":"I'm going to start off by saying that this class was hard. Really hard. Probably the hardest class I've ever taken. I breezed though 132 and pulled an A easily, but 216 kept me stressed almost the whole semester and especially during the last two weeks of the course.\n\r\nThis is the review of the course:\r\n-From what I've heard from friends the books are useless, don't buy them. (I didn't)\r\n-The entire course is in a Linux environment, through GRACE. If you're already familiar with Unix commands and such, you're in luck. Unfortunately I wasn't, and this made the first few weeks using it very, very confusing. Even at the end of the course I still felt weak with Unix.\r\n-You use Emacs to code in which is OK. The debugger is complicated and I never bothered leaning how to use it. I just debugged using print statements and other little tricks.\r\n-The major topics for the course were as follows: Learning basic C, Arrays in C, Structures, Pointers and pointer arithmetic, Makefiles, Dynamic Memory, Assembly, Process Control, Function pointers, Threads, and some misc.\r\n-Both Midterms and the Final were good. They were challenging but definitely not unreasonable and tested fair material.\r\n-The quizzes, on the other hand, were plain rude. The difficulty was unreasonable, they tested stupid material, they were graded harshly, and everyone failed the shit out of them. I failed every quiz except for 2.\r\n-Lab exercises were really hard for me, and I felt like everyone knew what they were doing except me. I would recommend trying to study the material that the lab is on beforehand. It's hard to ask questions when you're completely lost.\r\n-There were 6 projects, each of them took around 10-18 hrs to complete. Projects for this class were hard and stressful (a recurring theme). I didn't need office hours at all in 132 but I went for 4\/6 projects for 216. The difficulty of the projects went up for each one. Even though the projects were extremely challenging, I thought they were all semi-reasonable as long as you started early. Except for the last one. \r\n-(Mini rant) The last fucking project. Assigned literally 10 days before the final, it was easily the hardest and longest project of the year. Project 6 stressed me out so much that I felt like I was going to vomit in the coming days before it was due. (Right before the final remember) You have to pass 75% of the public tests for each project to pass the course, and I couldn't pass any of them until the day before the project was due. I tried to go to office hours all 3 days before it was due, and each day office hours had at least a 20 person waiting-list for 1 TA. I have NO IDEA what Jan was thinking. How difficult was the project to complete? Fuck if I know, I didn't even try to implement threading because I needed to study for my two hardest finals that were the first day of finals week. \r\n-Overall the course was VERY fast paced. Looking back I definitely learned a ton from the course, but I didn't really have time to get a thorough understanding of all the topics.\n\r\nThis is the review of Jan:\r\n-I'm giving Jan 4 stars mainly because I think her current rating of 2 is too low. \r\n-Jan is a very nice person and a pretty good lecturer. She has a good grasp on all the material and knows what she's talking about. It's not too hard to pay attention in class, there is just so much material that it's easy to instantly forget a lot of it.\r\n-The format of the class is a bit boring. Powerpoint lectures.\r\n-Some of the powerpoints are not well done and confusing. You really need to pay attention in lecture to figure out what's going on. Especially the powerpoint on Assembly, which I thought explained Memory very poorly.\n\r\nAdvice:\r\n-Go to class, study before the Lab Exercises and quizzes.\r\n-Start the projects as early as you can. I wish I hadn't procrastinated some of them.\r\n-Make a couple friends and talk about the projects together. Yeah it's technically against the rules, but it will keep you from going insane when working on the projects.\n","79":"I'm giving Sussman 5 stars because honestly, he's one of the better professors in comparison to the other CS professors in this department.\n\r\nIt is hard to pay attention in lecture because he doesn't make things very interesting (although, an intro computer science course will never be that interesting).\n\r\nHowever, he for sure knows what he's talking about, and he definitely explains things thoroughly.  Just try to get enough sleep and stay focused during lecture so you can learn because he does say good things.\n\r\nHe really does care about his students.  He is very nice during office hours and will respond to your concerns.","80":"216 is nobody's favorite class, from what I hear. I was dreading taking it, especially with an unfamiliar professor. But Sussman proved to be a very competent, engaging, thorough, and considerate instructor. Sure, it helped that I was already well-versed in the language the course is taught in (C) so that I didn't have to worry about syntax. Still, I believe Sussman covered things pretty well.\n\r\nHe is not very energetic, which would be nice for a 75-minute class, but I've had much worse. What matters is that he is a nice, sincere, accommodating guy who tries his best to deliver a good lecture and leave nothing obscure. I doubt you can do better than Sussman for 216...unless Fawzi is teaching it!\n\r\nThe first 2 exams, in my opinion, are perfectly fair. You can reasonably expect a A- or B+. The final was kinda hard and intentionally so; it was curved accordingly.\n\r\nI got an A+ in 216 (slightly higher than my grades for both 131 and 132)! ","81":"Dull voice, and comes off as a bit... insecure, but not quite snarky. He cares about his students, but wants them to take responsibility for their learning.\n\r\nBy no means a creative lecturer. Don't expect him to do much more than read off the slides - going to class is not really necessary, just make sure you read and understand.\n\r\nI have few complaints about this course, and think that 90% of it is extremely clear and relevant to CS. It's worth noting that there were a few things that were not explicitly covered in class\/slides that we were expected to know from the textbook (which is actually a very solid resource if you ever crack it open). For example, we needed to use exit() in a project before we went into process control and would have naturally encountered such system calls. Also, Assembly is tedious, but not devastatingly so.\n\r\nOverall, this is a very interesting course; as for the professor, it's probably not a huge factor in your experience. Do the projects early and be sure to understand what's going on.","82":"Sussman really isn't as bad as some of these reviews pose him as. It's a very difficult course designed as a \"weed-out\" and you really need to work hard and study continuously to do well. Sussman, however, gave very fair quizes, especially compared to the previous semester, with Keleher, and the quiz material was almost always predictable. He's a pretty decent lecturer, even if he does read off of the slides a lot. When you go to him for office hours, he really shows that he cares about you and will even stay longer than his hours if he's not done figuring out your issue. Overall, I felt he was a great teacher with fair assignments, especially for a non \"lecture\" professor.","83":"This is my first B of college, and it was a travesty the manner in which I lost my 4.0 gpa.\n\r\nTo quote a previous review:\r\n\"He is one of the most terrible, boring, and unresponsive professors you'll ever deal with. He DOESN'T care about you, nor he cares about your concerns. He is there to do his research, to get paid or whatever other reasons he might have. He is not there to teach you.\"\n\r\nSussman's projects were awfully and strictly graded, with averages in the 60%'s, and his tests were even worse, and had such difficult questions that everyone knew they failed (average on the tests were around 60%).\n\r\nMany people dropped this class with a W, others dropped Computer Science as a major, others got horrible grades and planned to retake the class. Whatever it is, this class was the doom of many people, and I took it the first semester it was offered, which means it was even more horribly taught than 212 since it was a new class.\n\r\nF*** you Sussman, and the computer science department, for making such a bullsh*t class with nothing to gain.\n\r\nI have no real-world knowledge of C or Assembly language programming from this class. Just my first B of college. That's all.","84":"Teaches reasonably on the current subjects but makes quizzes ridiculously difficult. Instead of putting the topics we've covered and practiced on the quizzes, he not only puts the most recent material but also the most abstract and picky questions.\r\nProjects were very difficult like any other teacher in 216.\r\nVery full of himself and difficult to approach. If you read all of the readings yourself and start the projects early, it's a manageable class.","85":"Stutters. Slow lectures. Exams are exactly the same as Herman's but the coding problems are much harder. Do not take.","86":"I've found Larry to be fairly entertaining and his lectures are useful. His project descriptions are extremely in-depth, so you have to read a lot, but I think that makes them fantastic. I think his exams and quizzes are fair once you start to figure him out and what he's looking for you to know. It seems like people either love him or hate him, but I love him.","87":"If someone actually gives herman a 1\/5, they are in for a rude awakening as the program continues. Herman is a strong lecturer if a little dry, and has very clear project descriptions. His exams are fair and do not try to trick you, if you do well on the projects and pay attention in class you will have little trouble with them. Likely one of the best professors throughout the CS program as a whole.","88":"Full disclosure, I was initially biased against Herman at the start of the semester due to a few exchanges I perceived as callous and unnecessarily severe. As a few other reviewers have said, he can come off as unapproachable and abrasive. But since taking his class, it's obvious that he is a good professor that puts a lot of effort into teaching. If you pay attention in lecture, take notes, and do the readings, you will do great. Herman simply demands that you put effort into the course to get a good grade.\r\n\r\nHis exams are fair if you've been taking notes and doing the readings, and projects are a non-issue if you start them early enough, and pay attention in discussion when debugging tools are covered. \r\n\r\nEssentially, attend class as expected, learn, do the readings, and you'll do fine and learn a great deal in the process. If that much effort is too much, then take another professor who may have lower standards.","89":"Gives ample resources to study with (lengthy practice exams before every exam and the final) along with detailed solution guides.\r\n\r\nI don't think anybody could possibly write better project descriptions. They can be upwards of 10 pages long, and cover literally everything you could want to know about how to write it. I have never had any confusion in terms of not knowing how to handle a certain case in a project due to this.\r\n\r\nExams aren't difficult if you study, but you will certainly have to know some small little details for each exam if you want to get an A or above on them.\r\n\r\nDefinitely recommend Herman for 132\/216\/anything else he's teaching","90":"Nice guy but as a teacher, very ineffective. He's too by the book, doesn't explain things in a conceptual way but instead the technical way. He made CMSC 216 a painful experience for me. Tried to befriend him and he wasn't having it. I followed his advice on how I could be successful in his class and I missed the curve by half a point...\r\n\r\nHe likes to cite studies that were done that show how to improve students learning and I followed every single one of them. I sat in the front row, I got to know him on a first name basis, I asked questions (and sometimes he would answer in a condescending way), and participated as much as I could with his worksheets.\r\n\r\nFind a better option. ","91":"Overall he's a pretty good professor that knows the material, however that being said the way he does tests is completely arbitrary with one having to know some minute detail that he covered for a brief time during his monotonous lectures. His projects are actually extremely well done and are very straightforward with him having a project description for each several pages long. But even if you pass all of the projects 100%, while it should give you insight into his testing methods, it does not. Herman I'd also completely unapproachable and hates being bothered for anything other than administrative reasons (which he will reiterate almost every lecture, yes really). If you had to choose between Herman and another teacher, Herman is actually a solid choice but be wary that his tests while not overtly difficult, are extremely roundabout and arbitrary. ","92":"One of the worst lecturers I have had so far. He has a stutter and doesn't communicate material well. Be prepared to teach yourself everything. His PowerPoints are incoherent and you would be better off using Wikipedia or a textbook as a resource. He does curve to compensate for the lower averages, however if you really want to learn something I would suggest taking another teacher.","93":"He makes silly jokes, feels very passionately about very specific things (like sitting in the frontest row possible), but overall he's a good instructor. His project descriptions are super clear and that's fantastic.","94":"Shankar is a nice guy if you were to ever speak with him. However as a professor i would avoid completely. The class relied heavily on a generous curve and the entire semester was a struggle to stay afloat. Good luck if you have him","95":"definitely recommend this TA\r\n","96":"people who complain about his no phone or laptop policy should just try to take a different professor, i mean how hard is it to spend 50 -75 mins not using your phone? i personally like this policy as it helps me focus during class better. \r\n\r\nhe can be strict at times, but he is overall a nice and funny guy. his lectures can get boring but that's just because the material is dry at times. his tests are EXTREMELY fair, as they are exactly like the practice exams. the projects (this semester at least) heavily relied on your ability to test your own program which is a practically skill in an actual job, but may seem annoying when doing actual projects. \r\n\r\noverall, i recommend herman for 216","97":"Herman is a great instructor. Sure, his policies initially can seem pedantic, but they are intended to help you learn. Herman not only knows his CS stuff very well, he also knows how to run a class so that the students learn the material effectively. He doesn't want you to use your electronics during lecture because research has shown that it impedes your learning, and from my personal experience, I found that I have been able to focus in lecture a lot better, and have followed this policy in my other classes. Additionally, he wants students to sit in the front and actively participate and answer questions because it actually helps you learn the material better. Everything he does is for a reason, and people who criticize him for these policies is not understanding the point of what he's trying do.\r\n\r\nIn regards to his teaching style, I personally think he's a funny dude, and he does a really good job at explaining the material comprehensively and thoroughly. There are worksheets in discussion that you really should do, and he provides really comprehensive project guides that pretty much give you all the information you could ever need. His administrative procedures are very refined, so you should have all the information you need about that. His tests are also very fair; they follow a similar format to his practice exams but sometimes with some curveball questions, but you should be capable of answering those.\r\n\r\nIf you want to succeed in his class, just pay attention in lecture, do his discussion worksheets, and start projects early. He's a great instructor, and you'll definitely get a thorough understanding of the material if you take him.\r\n\r\nPlus he's such a meme.","98":"I had Pedram for 216 and for 132. I think Pedram is a great lecturer and does a good job of explaining concepts. He tries to spend most of his time going over live coding examples as opposed to just reading off of the slides. For 216, Pedram co-taught with Herman so we had Herman's exams and projects. If Pedram is co-teaching definintely take him. However, if Pedram is not co-teaching like he was for my 132 class, his exams are definitely way more difficult, but not impossible. I recommend him!","99":"Very boring. Does not engage the class very well. His voice has a habit of putting half the class to sleep and his lectures do not keep your attention. He goes over concepts pretty well, and his diagrams\/drawings in class are helpful at times. When he makes his own exams, he is very pedantic about specific concepts, which is guaranteed to trip up most  students, including those who have a strong grasp of computer science.","100":"Larry is a solid lecturer. He is tough but extremely fair when it comes to grading.","101":"I had him for both 216 and 132. He's one of the best lecturers ever, but the classes are HARD. You're going to have to study a lot in order to do well in the class. For reference, I didn't pass 216 even while working a lot.\r\n\r\nProjects are only public test and secret test based, no release tests.\r\n\r\nExams are fair, make sure you study from the practice exams and HWs often in order to do well.","102":"Funny guy who will engage you with his demeanor and slides. If you have been doing well in 131 and 132 you should expect to do well as long as you put in the work for projects.","103":"Great professor. I was lucky enough to have him for both CMSC132 and CMSC216. Straightforward exams, great sense of humor. Encourages the making of memes on Piazza. Very approachable","104":"He's alright. Nothing special.","105":"He's a good TA. Very respectful and willing to help out and answer any questions, along with providing tips and tricks based off his own experiences.","106":"He is really great at engaging the majority of students but I tended to find his jokes to be childish and distracting. I didn't always feel welcome in his lectures. He had a routine where he would repeatedly pretend to interrupt students while they asked a question, and I found this to be disrespectful. Well-intentioned but lacking execution. His exams and grading are fair, and he gave a decent curve.","107":"He is a good TA. He gives you pointers and hints to get you to  the answer on your own, which really helps you understand the problem.","108":"Great exams\/projects, seems to care about his students. I found myself distracted in lecture a bit by his lecture style, since he tends to go back and forth between topics. Because of this, I think Pedram might be better at conveying the information we needed to learn","109":"He is very nice if you talk to him, but if you want to understand the material I would recommend either looking for another teacher or  preparing to rely heavily on the textbook.","110":"Amazing amazing amazing. Best CS professor in the department honestly. He cares so much about his students, actually understands that we might be going through stuff and offers help. He cares. If you tell me your favorite professor is Fawzi, then I'll know you never experienced having Nelson. Sure, the class is hard. But Nelson gives you a really strong foundation, and motivates you to do the comp sci major. ","111":"Best dude ever","112":"Really good lecturer. Some of his antics can be annoying, and his insistence that students sit close to the front of the lecture hall and not use electronic devices and that contact with TAs or instructors must be done in person were all silly or somewhat annoying, but otherwise he's great at explaining the material and his project descriptions are very clear, outlining every single edge case for students so that there isn't much of a need for a forum like Piazza. You'll have a very good understanding of the material by the end of semester. Would definitely recommend.","113":"He's Nelson... enough said","114":"Extremely harsh and unreasonable teacher. His curriculum doesn't make sense and makes time management extremely difficult. He assigns project due dates the day after exams and breaks. He focuses more on people not emailing him and not sitting in the back of the class more than he teaches. Very bland and hard to understand lecturer. ","115":"He is a fun and knowledgeable instructor. He tries to make jokes in class and explain things in an interesting way. He might be boring and strict on administrative stuff, but his teaching is beyond doubt fantastic. ","116":"Stutters, which makes his lectures impossible to follow. You're better off reading the slides or just showing up to Herman's lecture.","117":"Larry is awesome, and underrated as hell. Never had a better professor than him. Yeah, he doesn\u2019t let you use electronics, and yeah, he doesn't let you sit in the very back. Who cares? That\u2019s to your benefit.\r\n\r\nLarry is the best teacher I\u2019ve had at this school. Nobody can explain concepts like him. He just makes everything make sense.\r\n\r\nHis assignment descriptions are fantastic. Long, yes. But the few extra minutes it takes to read could save you hours of work compared to professors who don\u2019t really make it clear what they want.\r\n\r\nHe provides practice exams that include every single topic that could possibly be on the exam, so if there\u2019s anything you don\u2019t know, you now know that you should study it. Compare it to, say, Jason, whose practice exams inevitably leave something off that appeared on the real exam, and include something that isn\u2019t on the exam, wasting everyone\u2019s time. The point of the practice exam is to let me know what I don\u2019t know! I don\u2019t know that I don\u2019t know something unless there\u2019s a question asking me about it!\r\n\r\nLarry is underrated. The GOAT, if you ask me.","118":"Herman may seem unapproachable, but if you understand and like his odd sense of humor then you'll have an easier time approaching him. He does talk very fast, but if he repeats something he says it's probably very important. His slides are super detailed, but reading the books and going to office hours will help fill in the gaps. I repeat, go to office hours, because you're going to need all the help you can get for his projects. The projects are tough but the descriptions are very detailed, so read those before you even touch your keyboard. As for his exams, you either know the answer or you don't, since you can't really look at one part of the exam to help you answer another part. And yes, Herman does have laser vision and will see through the tables to find you on your cellphone, so use your phone at your own risk.\r\nAll in all, this class is challenging and Herman does a good job of explaining it. As a bonus, he gave out chocolate to random people for several lectures in a row. Additionally, he made his Halloween lecture about zombies, so if you want to learn more take him in the fall when lecture falls on Halloween.","119":"Solid lecturer. Awkward and strict about things but good guy. Attendance is important. He repeats key things in lectures a lot. Slides are kinda incomplete. ","120":"I had him before for 132 and I hated him. I only picked him again for 216 because he was better than Shankar. Herman is completely boring once again and makes me fall asleep with his monotone voice. So I would have to go home and review his powerpoints and examples (since he doesn't record nor allow phones\/laptops in class), which are extremely vague. I even read the textbook for goodness sake and was still confused in a class because there is so much information in the textbook that I don't know what he wants us to know for class.\r\n\r\nBy far the worse lecturer I've had. ","121":"Larry can be very monotonous, which may make it tough for people to pay attention, but he does try to make 216 easy to understand. He may seem unapproachable but if you go to his office hours, you will find out that he is a pretty nice guy. Overall, I would say he's not great, but good.","122":"Took him in Summer 2019. The best!!! Such positive energy and lighthearted jokes to break up the content :) Loved the way he taught the class, so now I'm about to TA for the first time for 216 (not for Nelson tho :(((( )","123":"Great lecturer, has very reasonable exams and practice material, and INCREDIBLY CLEAR project descriptions. ","124":"Lectures were basically useless because of the stuttering and volume, ended up just going to Larry's lectures. Definitely knows his stuff, just can't teach it very well.","125":"Horrible lecturer.  He is very hard to listen to and doesn't seem prepared for lectures.  I ended up going to a different section's lecture for the class because I couldn't focus on him.","126":"Yoon is a good professor for the material he teaches. I see that he has taught CMSC411 in the past, which does not surprise me. Yoon likes to attack the details of memory and other minutiae of the work done in the class. This is a good thing for those who can get a conceptual grasp of the content, but for those who are just here to code, it will be considerably difficult. Many students took to watching Nelson's lectures from previous semesters after the move to online because Yoon's lecture style proved too difficult to keep up with for some without being able to ask questions as they came to mind. Taking the time to understand Yoon's lecture style did prove very useful and I felt I learned quite a bit from the course overall.\r\n\r\nYoon's exams are tricky for similar reasons. Unlike Nelson, who will usually make his exams based around high-level understanding with code, a lot of Yoon's questions felt like tricks. There was a \"catch\" of some description in almost every coding question across all three exams, which can be annoying if one detail causes you to lose many points.\r\n\r\nYoon (and moreso Shankar) unfortunately did not do the best job of transitioning to the online environment after COVID-19 began making its rounds. I think they were unprepared for the scope of what they had to transition to, and as the semester progressed both got fairly crass. I don't hold this against Yoon too much, however, because the transition was hard for everyone.\r\n\r\nOverall, I'd recommend Yoon if Nelson is not teaching the course. You can always fall back on Nelson's material if Yoon's style does not make sense to you. Be prepared for tricky exams, but if you understand the low-level implementation of many different features in C, you should be able to score at minimum a B in the course.","127":"Sometimes hard to keep up with during lectures, but he knows his stuff","128":"I love herman. He is arguably the best lecturer we have in the CS dept","129":"This professor has been THE LEAST accomodating professor during this pandemic. He assumes so much about his students. He assumes that if you aren't on top of everything 24\/7, then you don't care about the class and you don't care about your grade. Although the university is telling their professors to be accommodating, his policies are still incredibly strict. He's also the most condescending professor I've ever had. Don't take a class with him if you value your mental health.","130":"Nice guy, much nicer than Herman. Knows the course material very well and is response to students.\r\nUnfortunately, he has a stutter that makes his lectures very hard to understand.","131":"He does try to make lecture engaging, albeit not very successfully. It is possible to do well in this class, but be prepared to spend an obscene amount of time studying and reading from the textbook. He is not accommodating despite having an online semester and feels that only his class matters.","132":"The worst professor I've had at UMD so far. ","133":"Truly the worst professor I've had at UMD.  ","134":"Honestly, Herman is probably the worst professor I've ever had. He's not a bad lecturer but he's not great either, he shuts down students asking questions and has such a rigid structure to lectures is pretty annoying. Also the way he's formatted the class virtually is kinda annoying too, from requiring a password to access any files to how office hours work. I do feel like he'd be a better professor with an in person class but he hasn't made a good transition to online classes and expects too much out of students.","135":"Honestly, Herman is probably the worst professor I've ever had.

I do feel like he'd be a better professor with an in person class but he hasn't made a good transition to online classes and expects too much out of students.","136":"Took his class when it was co-taught by Herman. He is, in my opinion, a far better lecturer than Herman IF you can pay attention through his stuttering. It was definitely more interesting and easy to understand the concepts Shankar taught. Again, this is if you can pay attention through the stuttering. I can't really speak about his exams or quizzes though b\/c I'm pretty sure they were Herman's, at least for my year.","137":"He is the textbook definition of a lecturer that does it because they have to and not because they like it. If he does enjoy his job it is not reflected at all in his lectures. He frequently interrupted his students when they tried to ask simple questions and told them instead to go to office hours (which I was told were super busy). There were times where the questions were too in-depth for him to answer quickly, but often times he didn't give students a chance to ask the question. You can do well in this course, and if it was in person I feel like it would be a better experience, but he was almost harming accomodation for students rather than helping by restricting lectures to certain sections earlier in the semester and only lecturing once a day instead of 3 times a day like he was supposed to, which meant that if you had class during the time that he decided to hold lecture, you had to then accomodate another 75 minutes out of the day to watch his lecture. There are better lecturers than him.","138":"Tought in joint with Shankar.\r\n\r\nHe's a knowledgeable guy as a CS teacher, but he never let students ask questions, and his lectures were so boring. \r\n\r\nThere were a LOT of projects, and the PDF descriptions seemed as if he went out of his way to make them hard to interpret. The exams were hard, but I suspect that's standard across CMSC216 sections. \r\n\r\nWouldn't recommend him to anyone.\r\n\r\nPS,\r\nStart your projects early. It often took students 1-2 days just to understand what the project was asking for.","139":"Taught in joint with L. Herman.\r\n\r\nAlthough I feel horrible saying this, he is very hard to listen to (stutter). He seems like he really cares about students, but his lectures were boring. He's always willing to take questions, unlike Herman, and always willing to take the time needed to answer them.\r\n\r\nThe only interaction I had with him was during one office hours session, were he was quick to find the issue and resolve my problem. \r\n\r\nProbably would avoid him if possible, but take him over Herman.","140":"shut the fuck up about his stutter. if you think a stutter makes a class hard to teach, how about you cut off your tongue and see how hard it is to ask questions.\r\n\r\nhe goes slow in lectures, yes, but he's not unprepared. I had this class online so it was co-taught with Herman, and yes, if you want a \"better instructor\" in terms of quantity of content and breadth of content covered go for Herman. \r\n\r\nBut Shankar knows his stuff when it comes to explaining concepts in memory with diagrams. he is thorough in his lectures, but yes, slow, and perhaps, for you folk who can't sit down and listen, you will \"lose interest quickly\". at times, he might not fully divulge the nuances for concepts that require more exposition, or detail verbally. he will not explain the slides for a lecture, or clarify them in the clearest way (in my case, it was with: register spilling, clarifying the functions of registers, and the instructions to load values into registers). \r\n\r\nThat being said, the way the course is designed itself is very good. the homeworks, worksheets, and projects are your ticket to a good grade in this class. The lectures, resources, and textbook correspond to a good majority of the content, and you will not have to fuss to find more content to learn from if you pay careful attention to the content given. ","141":"I am so torn. I have come to really like Larry over the past two semesters with him (216 and 132), but I will admit he is 100% not for everyone. His project descriptions are legendary, and the projects were delightfully challenging. His exams can be difficult, but he'll curve accordingly. I think he is understanding of students when the students' sentiment is widespread. The discussion work is graded for participation which is such a nice change. He's quirky, and weird, but works really hard for his students. I see why he gets the bad rep (I did not like him at first, even completely after 132), but I personally have come to like him. ","142":"I took this course in Spring 2020.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Lectures are quite boring, and once we went online they became significantly longer.\r\n- Exam content was completely unlike the practice, ESPECIALLY for the final. Practice material given was utterly insufficient in terms of relevance.","143":"Not a great choice, slow grader, everything gets graded the last second. Everything is self-taught which has a change on grades. If you know everything pick him, otherwise stay away","144":"HES THE WORST, If you have him game over","145":"As a senior, who is doing a double major with engineering, I say that he is the worst professor that I have had at UMD. He rambles and does not connect with students at all. If you learn on your own, you will have no problem with him because you would have already taught yourself everything that you need to know. It is unfortunate to have professors like this who you technically pay to teach you. However, learning on your own is an essential skill in Comp Sci anyways. Stay away if you can.","146":"Although Yoon is a decent (in-person) lecturer, once the pandemic started his exams were insanely difficult, with barely any time and literally nothing we learned on it.  Half of the class would fail these disastrously bad exams. Also, projects were vague and confusing, and the lectures online were scratchy, boring, and equally confusing. DO NOT TAKE.  ","147":"Disclaimer: I took these courses in 2018. I'm a senior now.\r\n\r\nHerman was pretty much the epitome of a hard but fair professor. He can come off as kind of a dick and he certainly has his quirks but he is by far the fairest professor I've had in CS. His exams are pretty much identical to the practice exams and there are generally little to no trick questions involved. His project descriptions are extremely thorough and well written, which any upper classman would know is a rarity in this department. I don't know how he handled the transition to online but as an in-person professor he's my absolute favorite. If you're willing to put in the work for his class, you will do good. ","148":"Actually the GOAT! I could see how some other people don't like him because he's very pedantic, especially with projects. However, because he's very exact, you know exactly what to do and there's \"what if's\" to worry about. Also, he provides tons of study material that, if you do and understand them, you will get at least a B on the exam. When taking him, the amount of work you put in correlates to the grade you receive. ","149":"Best TA ever. Best teaching, best help, and deadass a G.","150":"I had him this semester and was nervous but he turned out to be a really good teacher. The class is just time consuming, but he teaches the material really well because everything on the exams and projects is always covered in a clear and straightforward way in the lectures. I loved his lectures. His lectures waste 0 time and are super direct and packed with material (useful in online learning where you can just note everything he says, and use that note sheet as most of your studying). He is always very clear in his lectures to its easy to follow along. He gives tons of resources to prepare for exams (practice exams, homework and worksheets which are usually optional) and he really seems like he wants us to do well. ","151":"ABSOLUTE G. He spent so much time with me and helped me get a good grade on the class. Deserves 10 Llamas as a prize for being the GOAT.","152":"Genuinely the worst professor I have ever had. His lectures are completely useless and boring to watch. The exams are completely unfair, with one small trivial question on each exam (minimal partial credit) corresponding to 3-5% of your ENTIRE grade. If I could give negative 5 stars, I certainly would. I would not recommend this class to anyone, even my worst enemy.","153":"The class can be difficult at times but if you start the projects 1-2 days after they are assigned you will be fine. Project descriptions are very long but reading every sentence is important if you want to get a good grade. ","154":"OK lecturer but is highly pedantic and nitpicks projects\/exams. Helps students as minimally as he possibly can in lectures and office hours, moreso in online than in person","155":"The way Larry formats his online classes is very unpleasant. The class is time-consuming and unforgiving. His lectures are OK, very boring but they get the job done. He is not great at answering student questions, cutting students off often, so go to office hours for help. His projects are fair, just make sure to read every sentence of the wordy document very carefully. The problem is that exams are very unforgiving and weighted very heavily compared to projects in the class. He is a slow grader. If you want to do well, make sure you pour in 110% of your effort.","156":"Larry is a great teacher. He teaches concepts well and gives very detailed explanations of why it's so. However the reason why this review is a 3 star is because of the exams. They are completely unfair and do not accurately test one's learning in this course. Many questions are multi select and test over obscure one off questions rather than the high level concepts that are very well explained. The most you will learn in this class is from the projects where you get to implement the ideas that are discussed in class and in discussion. This class could be great if the exams were a bit more fair. In my opinion if Larry dropped the lowest scoring test and raised the project weight, this class would be a 4 or 5 star.","157":"He's honestly a pretty good lecturer, except for the fact that he seems super against people asking questions. And sometimes I don't really feel like I understand a lot of concepts until I watch the lectures over again, but that might just be me. Like people said, his project descriptions can seem super dense and overwhelming, but they're pretty helpful and I found the projects here to be easier than 132 (since you're doing a lot of basic stuff, just in C). His grading is pretty ridiculous, the first exam was returned over a month later and many projects are still ungraded even though we're coming close to the P\/F deadline. He did, however, grade the last exam in about a week, so I'll give him that. His online tests are pretty ridiculous because of the brutal multiple choice (each question have multiple answers and you have to choose all) that he claims is only graded harshly because that's how ELMS says it has to. The averages on all our exams have been around 68%, I think. He does come off as rude and condescending, probably due to his voice, but he's honestly a nice guy. He does have lots of annoying policies like no emails, limiting questions in lectures, only submit projects once, etc. though. If you have him, it's definitely going to be a challenging and annoying class\/semester, but there are certainly far worse teachers here. ","158":"This man will make you hate computer science. He will also make you hate yourself and the entire university.","159":"\u2022 Having a good grade in a class doesn\u2019t mean an instructor was good \r\n\u2022 Being able to manage a trash prof- oh I meant lecturer, doesn\u2019t suddenly make them good \r\n\r\nJust had to put that out there towards the students who, in their reviews and group me\u2019s, like to downplay just how shitty this instructor is. \r\n\r\nFor one, he restricts the kind of material that you can use when completing projects, so that the only way to know the acceptable concepts you can use, is to watch is lectures, where he frequently cuts students with questions and says \u201ccome to my office hours\u201d to pertinent questions.\r\n\r\nManaged to find alternative, clever ways to arrive at an answer during your projects? How cute, can\u2019t use it, wasn\u2019t covered in class.\r\n\r\nImagine i asked you to compute the roots of a polynomials; anyone who\u2019s taken precalc knows that there are *several* ways to do this, and everyone has a preference for which method to use. Imagine i told you: oh, you only have to do it one particular way, and it turned out to be the way that hasn\u2019t clicked for you. Well tough luck\r\n\r\nThis is only beneficial to students who have little programming experience, because, otherwise, you start filtering out *lots of concepts* you\u2019d naturally internalized over your years of programming.\r\n\r\nNever in my life have I seen such idiotic modus operandi for a course, not even Intro to DS which is a super difficult course. His excuse? I dOnT wAnT sTudEnts to make mistakes that are hard to debug , as if students don\u2019t already struggle with the concepts taught HIS way!\r\n\r\nThis means that you can\u2019t rely on learning from SO or YouTube, unless you can *ensure* that their methods of teaching, illustrating a concept or constructing an algorithm are pedantically similar to his ways.\r\n\r\nTell me again how such a \u201clecturer\u201d manages to earn the \u201chE\u2019s hOneSTLy gOoD\u201d review. Again having a good grade in the class doesn\u2019t make the instructor a good one. \r\n\r\nThe icing? You blow this fuss over projects that will end up having so little weight towards your overall grade. Can\u2019t even skip some of them though, because GFA will give you to complete them. His excuse? We want you to make sure to understand the concepts as following topics will rely on them. Guess what? It\u2019s possible to understand concepts and do poorly on projects, especially given the insanely long descriptions (that magnify the likelihood of\r\nMissing crucial details) and the self indulgently silly requirements. But who cares? Do as Larry says\r\n\r\nNow the tests: ah, ain\u2019t it beautiful that the last question of every test is not only the longest, but also weight 1\/4 of the overall test\u2019s grade? Not only are the projects insanely painstaking (with *little* reward), but the exams are set up for you to fail.\r\n\r\nAnd he has the audacity to pretend to be shocked at the consistently low averages in the class\r\n\r\nThe kicker? With all this perfectionism of his, he has no qualms about cancelling lectures\/discussions to \u201cgo to a doctor appointment\u201d, no qualms about making mistakes in project descriptions, no qualms about missing certain topics in lectures. Basically a \u201cdo as I say, not as I do\u201d kind of person \r\n\r\nHe is honestly the kind of person you\u2019re sl disgusted at that not a single word or rant can describe how *pointlessly* despicable he is, and for *no* reason! ","160":"People obviously have a lot of strong opinions about Herman. He definitely isn't the best, but I thought he was fine.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n1. Informative lectures. He explains things pretty well. If you don't like going to lecture though, his slides are informative enough.\r\n2. He's easy to talk to in office hours if you don't mind his sarcasm and bluntness. I didn't mind it, but I know some people might.\r\n3. Curves pretty generously.\r\n4. The Good Faith Attempt for every project was to just pass half the public tests, which I liked much more than how it was in 131\/132.\r\n5. He has a lot of memorable quotes lol\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n1. Grading takes way too long. Project and exam grades easily take over a month.\r\n2. Exams were insane. He gives several multiple choice where you need to pick all the answers that apply. If you pick a wrong answer you lose points for that question. He also gives a debugging problem that's worth 20-25% of the exam grade, and if you can't find the bug or change it correctly then say goodbye to a good amount of points.\r\n3. For some reason, the release date for a new project always seemed to be a day or 2 before another exam, so you're stuck studying but you also have to worry about a new project. Unless you procrastinated, I would STRONGLY advise putting off studying and trying to finish whatever new project is released before an exam. His debugging questions are usually related to whatever new topic the project covers.\r\n\r\nOverall I don't think he's a bad professor, but I can definitely see why a lot of people don't like the way he teaches.","161":"I really do not get all the 4 and 5 star reviews below, at most he gets a 3 star. So for starters his lectures are very dry, this may be due to online semester, I do not know completely. I may stun a lot of people by saying this but I believe his exams in terms of content are quite fair, almost all the topics are touched upon in the review guide and I was never like \"oh wow i have never seen this before\". \r\nNow the problem with his exams is:\r\n1) Multiple choice questions with like e options where there are multiple answers and say you picked A and D when the Answer is A and E, you would in that case gain 0pts because when you pick a wrong option, you lose points.\r\n2) He made us install lockdown and join a live zoom call, now I understand why he does this, but its important to note how extremely intrusive lockdown browser is\r\n3) Every exam has a 50pt \"find the error\" type problem which is great if you find the error, but obviously if you cannot, there goes 50pts on a 200pt exam\r\n\r\nNow that isnt the only problem with this class. His projects have almost 1% weight in the class. For the hours of work required to finish these projects, they have almost no significance on your grade at all. Speaking of grades, he takes a century to grade exams and projects and then uses the \"TA's are busy people\" excuse. Like we have not received grades on projects we completed over a MONTH ago. Not to mention there is NO Piazza, so I can see how easily it is for students to fall when they do fall because their is a lack of help. The TA's also are most of the time complete and utterly useless when it comes to project help, not to mention the wait times were quite long. Herman also has this extremely weird obsession with the book for this class, like he will make you read like 40 page chapters of it and then test you content that was covered on the book.\r\n\r\nHerman himself seems like a Nice guy, he comes across as condescending a lot , he is very thorough in his project descriptions (the pdf handout for the projects are like 20 pages minimum). He however, does not understand his students very well and if their are other options for professors, i'd gravitate towards them, however, if you get herman it really isnt the end of the world and I am sure you will make it out fine.","162":"I get that his teaching style doesn't please everyone, he can be somewhat harsh and it's hard to ask questions. Still, he is a great lecturer and has a sense of humor. The exams are fair, project assignments are very clear. The grading does take forever though.","163":"These reviewers be like \"I got a good grade, therefore herman is 5 stars!\" If you can avoid him, avoid him, if you can't then I guess fight for your grade. He grades SLOWLY, his project descriptions are probably the only good thing about him. His lectures are useless, his slides for the lectures are incomplete and barely help. Exams are tough, projects are worth next to null in this class, despite taking days to complete. The TA's in this class were almost as bad as him, this class was an awful experience and I cannot wish this upon my worst enemies.","164":"Lectures are very dry and pedantic. He gives generally fair (though difficult) exams and a lot of practice material to go along with it, and his project descriptions are great. Grading takes absolutely forever and isn't always accurate on the first run-through, but I'm not sure how much of this is his fault specifically vs. his TAs. Absolutely refuses to answer any questions by course-mail\/e-mail\/some other online means like Piazza - he always expects you to attend office hours if you want to ask something, even if it is a simple clarification question. ","165":"This class will take up so much of your time, from projects to preparing for exams, there are literally no breaks. You'll seriously be tested on how well you are able to study for exams and actually look at material outside of class. If you don't understand something, there are always resources to help you, it's just a matter of making time to use them outside of lecture and discussion. This is relevant regardless of any person teaching the class. \r\n\r\nAs a lecturer(don't call him professor meme), Herman can only do so much although there are some critiques of him in the other reviews that can be accurate. The class is hard, but it's not like Herman makes it harder. He explains concepts well and the worksheets and homework are a must if you really want to get a concept down. \r\n\r\nExpect the outcome of this class to be a function of how much work you put in. ","166":"*Disclaimer- this review was done during online instruction so it may not be entirely accurate when it comes to in person, but please read because it can give you a general sense about who Larry is.*\r\n\r\nThis man is the worst professor that you could ever have. People who review 4 or 5 star must be on something or just naturally gifted at cs.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass setup: You only got to go to lecture once every 2 weeks. I even got lecture zoom links for times when I was in other classes, so I couldn\u2019t go. The rest was watch the lecture videos which are posted roughly 8-16 hrs later. Worst experience ever, literally COULDN\u2019T go to live lecture for a whole month. Had to schedule other classes around finding time to watch lecture videos whenever they got posted out of the blue, screwing up any relative organization of my classes. He often cuts of students asking questions and just says come to my office hours. No Piazza, cannot email him and regular office hours with TAs are a mess. Also have fun seeing your exam and project grades a month after completing them. Very hard to guess where you grade is at for 80% of the semester. \r\n\r\nProjects: First off, only public and secret. Can only submit up to I think it was 6 times before you were penalized. Have to run tests using Grace. Oh that\u2019s another thing, the super ancient system and the way that everything is taught using emacs. Just use vscode. There should be a document floating around about how to set it up. Content wise they are fair ngl. The project descriptions are about 10 pages long so I\u2019d say 95% of common errors and edge cases are explained. If you follow the documentation and code to covers those cases  the projects will still be hard but you will be fine passing the public tests and probably some of the secret tests. DO NOT procrastinate on them. They are weighted incredibly low so they do jacksht for you grade. \r\n\r\nExams: These are basically the do or die of this class. I think majority of averages were around 68%, with one at 56%. The way you have to answer the multiple choice which pretty much usually has more than one answer is super stupid. Let\u2019s say there are two answers out of 5. Suppose that A & B are correct but you put down A & C and, so the points gained and lost for that question equal out to zero, so it is like you never attempted the question. You have to be super confident to get points on these because any incorrect answers will lower your grade. Don\u2019t even try to guess on these questions because you will just hurt your grade. If that wasn\u2019t enough there is a question at the end which takes the longest, but also in a sense is a simple you get it or you don\u2019t. It is worth 25% of the test grade and around 3-5% of you course grade so prey that you know the answer or your grade will hurt just from that.\r\n\r\nPlease avoid taking him at any cost. Then again, have heard that he is better in person.","167":"I found his lectures to be very clear. He is a good instructor and also quite reasonable when it comes to handling issues. The only issue I found with his class was that project descriptions were overcomplicated and unnecessarily long.","168":"The stutter isn't even in issue if you pay attention - he's just a bad teacher. He talks like he expects you to already understand everything and doesn't repeat or clarify anything he says. It's almost as if he is just regurgitating a text book or something, his in person instruction is no better than what you would get from just reading the lecture slides. I ended up going to a different section for my lectures and my understanding of the material improved dramatically. \r\n\r\nDo not take his class.","169":"Took him in Spring 2021. I've seen so many negative reviews on him, but honestly, he was one of the best CS professors I've ever had. His class is extremely clear. Lectures go through all necessary content, project descriptions detail everything you need to know, and exam practice questions are really similar to what is on the exam. If you follow his direction, you will do well.","170":"Herman was a pretty good professor honestly. His exams were really hard and and it took his TAs forever to grade anything, but he explained things well and his project descriptions, while really long and tedious, covered any edge case questions people had. Just study well and you'll be fine","171":"Amazing at lecturing and making the material easy to understand. Seems like a super nice and down-to-earth guy too. You will need to put some work into the class for an A, but with JMT getting a B is super attainable with not a whole lot of effort. If you can, choose Jose for 216 hands down- he also records his lectures which are super convenient. ","172":"Jose is a great lecturer. He was funny and always took time to go over examples and questions. His exams were challenging but not unfair. An effective lecturer. There were problems with grades coming back slow and TAs not doing their job properly however he did his best to respond and fix these concerns. Highly reccomend.","173":"Shankar seems like a nice person from the very small amount of personal interaction I had with him during the semester in the form of fleeting after-class conversations and from Piazza. But - and this is a major BUT - he's a terrible lecturer. I got through the entire semester by reading from the slides posted online (as the class was cotaught this semester) and frequently skipped lectures, they were just straight up unhelpful. By the end of the semester, there were about 12 or 13 people still attending the lecture hall that should seat over 100. He seems incredibly knowledgeable, and I'm sure he's very very well-versed in the subject that he teaches, but his ability to convey that knowledge to the students in a lecture format is very poor.","174":"He's a very good lecturer and will make sure you understand the concepts. Highly recommend you take his section if possible.","175":"Jose is fantastic. He is extremely funny, communicates the material well, and is extremely willing to help students learn the material. Take his section if you can.","176":"Great lecturer, very knowledgeable, and took the time to answer questions. I left every lecture with a deeper understanding of the topics we were being taught, it was definitely worth my time to attend. The course itself was pretty mismanaged with tons of pushed deadlines, TA drama, and minimal communication with students, however, I strongly believe this was a product of the course being cotaught with Shankar. I would still go out of my way to take Jose again.","177":"Jose is a fantastic professor. He is an incredible lecturer and very patient with students\/willing to take questions. His lectures are never boring and his office hours is always super useful. Jose cares about the quality of his teaching and students' understanding a lot more than most professors. If you have the option to take 216 with him, do it. From personal experience he's far better than Shankar, and from what I hear, he's much better than Herman and probably comparable to Nelson. ","178":"I only went to his lectures during the first week of school, and I did not understand a thing. He speaks incredibly softly and it is hard to hear him, and he teaches like you already know all of the content. He co-taught with Calderon this semester and I just attended Calderon's lectures instead. Half of the TAs were not even doing their job and some actually got fired and we never got any grades back on time, so we went half the semester without even having a single grade. Overall, this class was a mess.","179":"When I took this class (Fall 2019), I didn't enjoy it mainly because I hate C. However, Larry is a really good intructor and does a good job of explaining concepts, even if his lectures are really dry. His teaching style may not work for everyone, which is probably why he has a lot of negative reviews, but  after taking some 400 level classes with professors who don't know how to teach, I think that Larry did a great job. He can be very particular about seemingly random things, like sitting in the back row or using tech in class, but overall you can tell he cares about the class (unlike a lot of CS profs at this university). His slides are comprehensive and he gives good review materials for the exams. The only thing I didn't like was that he took attendance and had 2 participation points (which means you had to ask 2 questions or answer his questions at some point throughout the semester). ","180":"Notice that most of the reviews for Shankar are by students that did not attend his lecture. I attended his lecture all semester, and I felt that he did a good job. I ended up with a good grade in the class. This is just a difficult subject. It was actually nice that everyone went to the other lecture. We had a more personal experience, and he had more time to answer individual questions. I'm even curious if students that went to the other lecture did any better.","181":"I agree with all the other review of Jose so I'll keep it short. I'm a sophomore so this was my first semester of in person classes. Jose is the best lecturer I've had during my time at Maryland, or at least he is a solid S tier CS lecturer. Attend lectures and put time into studying the lecture examples he points out. Like actually try modifying the examples and predict what happens when you change something in the example. That's how you study and learn. I never really knew how to study for CS classes until I took 216 with Jose and will be sure to use this method of studying in my future classes. Had I studied the correct way for the earlier exams, I believe attaining at least a B was incredibly doable in this class. ","182":"Dr. Shankar is for sure knowledgeable, but you really need to force yourself to pay 100% of your attention during lectures. He doesn't repeat information and assumes you have previous knowledge. ","183":"Amazing lecturer. Always answered questions during lecture very thoroughly, and he seemed very knowledgeable about all of the topics. Would recommend taking him if possible.","184":"This man is the greatest professor of all time...","185":"I only attended his lectures during important dates because I could not understand a thing.  He teaches like you know the content already and its already hear to hear him.  His exams are way harder than the practice exams given.  If you are going to take him be prepared or have fun on repeating the course.","186":"Great professor, very knowledgeable. However, terribly organized class. Exams and projects took forever to be graded.","187":"AMAZING ","188":"The course was co-taught with Jose... I dunno why everyone says Jose gave fair exams while over here I see a lot about the exam being ridiculous(which I agree with 100%). Just find it a bit weird over the inconsistency. Lectures from both professors were mid in my opinion- I found it really hard to study for the exams \/ be prepared as the questions were borderline random. No worries bc everything is \"fair game\". Grading took forever, and unfortunately the TAs were as knowledgeable as the students this semester. Overall, a dumpster fire of a class.","189":"Shankar expects you to engage with the material and THINK! CMSC216 can not be memorized and requires consistency with the material. It's a big step up from CMSC132. Shankar was an effective instructor. While his lectures did not rely as much on the slides, he conveyed the course content well, provided many detailed examples, and always answered questions. This class is tough, but if you are willing to put in the time, you can succeed. \r\n\r\nDo not rely on old practice exams too much, and focus on the code examples, making changes to it, and predicting the new output. Understand the purpose of every code example and every function used in the example. Be able to use the syntax and functions in novel scenarios. Truly understand the concepts so that you can apply them in novel problems. I recommend previewing the slides the night before a lecture and preparing questions to ask during lecture. Take note of key points and especially about code examples. Review after class. Form a weekly study group. Don't just start coding the assignments; spend time thinking through a plan and edge cases first. You got this!!\r\n\r\nGo to office hours! Shankar is extremely knowledge and patient. He really wants to see you succeed and cares to help you engage deeply and accurately with the course content. ","190":"Larry is a good professor if you're willing to learn. His pace is slow, and he cares about you actually learning the material. He is very strict and rather boring, but he will get you the information.\r\n\r\nI recommend him if you can sit through boring lectures without using your phone and are genuinely willing to learn the content thoroughly.","191":"One of the worst instructors in the CS department and the university, avoid it!","192":"jose is a good prof mans is the throat goat. def take if available ","193":"He is a good lecturer indeed but I believe good lectures only go so far as if you provide the proper material to grade. I understand that he was not in charge of exam designs but I think washing your hands about it is not the solution. Last semester, when Shankar was in charge of exam design, questions weren't properly worded and the level of difficulty was not in the same range as the time provided. I really hope that changes and they allow more control regarding his course, but I believe that as a teacher, he was required to put his foot down and say: I don't agree with this exam unless you do agree.","194":"Nelson is simply fantastic! Super passionate, engaging, and offers so many resources for students to be successful! His exams are also very fair, especially if they're online. Best instructor for computer science at UMD by a mile. Had him for CMSC133 too.","195":"(Obligatory disclaimer: I took this course with Larry Herman in Spring 2021 when it was taught fully online. However, I currently tutor students in CMSC216 and from what they tell me, nothing is different now with in-person instruction.)\r\n\r\nAs someone who studies pedagogy and is looking to be a professor, I can confidently say that Larry Herman does not know how to teach, especially in computer science. The fact that he will not allow any electronics (even for note-taking) during lectures on computer programming should tell you enough about what kind of instructor Herman is.\r\n\r\nExams are simply excruciating. While other instructors are moving to exam formats that function more like open-note timed projects (a more realistic scenario in software development), Herman insists on the practice of writing and debugging computer software using a pencil and paper... Additionally, exams often involve questions needing a specific process not covered in the course, and the multiple choice questions are outrageously formatted and graded. During online instruction, Herman insisted on Zoom proctored exams that required invasive lockdown browsers (I love taking exams with a TA staring directly at my face 24\/7. Really calms me down).\r\n\r\nProjects are mostly fair in terms of what they cover, but the administration over them is needlessly awful. Firstly, project descriptions are convoluted and unnecessarily long. This may help to uncover some edge-cases, but it takes about a day just to digest everything. Secondly and most importantly, you will be penalized if you submit too often before the deadline. No more convenient project backups or even just seeing if you're passing all public tests.\r\n\r\nCourse structure and lectures are not the worst, but Herman is weirdly against answering questions during lecture and fully embracing things like ELMS and Piazza so there's that.\r\n\r\nOverall, Herman makes this course much harder than it needs to be and for absolutely no payoff whatsoever.\r\nI will say that he is understanding if you need an extension and have a valid reason, and he does at least seem to like what he covers. However, this does not change the fact that you should avoid him if you like having a good GPA.","196":"Larry gives a lot of practice through homeworks and worksheets. Also, his projects are thoroughly detailed, but extremely annoying to read.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, Larry is extremely boring. Most people sleep throughout his class and are forced to rewatch the lectures. Also, his exams don't test you on most of the material in the class, they only test you on some very specific topics. Like for example, for the second exam in the semester, we only had one small problem on processing that we had to correct as the \"test\" for that unit. That was a MAJOR unit, and we didn't even have to trace any fork calls or anything. The coverage in the exams is horrendous.","197":"Herman is a decent lecturer. His projects are difficult. And, he has a lot of silly rules that get annoying. Herman's teaching style is Draconianly strict. He gives you a 12 page list of directions detailing exactly how he wants you to do every little detail of an assignment. You'll do fine with Herman, but you'd probably rather take someone else. If it means anything, Herman taught CMSC216 better than CMSC132.","198":"He is a good professor. \r\n\r\nHis exams are fair and are much easier than the review guides. If you attempt all the questions on the review and spend time understanding each question's solution, you will do fine on the exams. \r\nThe exam questions are typically simplified versions of study guide questions. Maybe not for the multiple-choice, that will be the same difficulty. \r\nAlso, I suggest rewatching lectures and taking notes on topics you do not fill comfortable with. \r\n\r\nFor the projects, use office hours and START EARLY!! \r\nIf you know you usually do badly on projects, spend some time before the class starts to remake a 132 project for example in C. (Also, I highly suggest understanding the basics of malloc() before the class starts)\r\n\r\n\r\n ","199":"I took both 132 and 216 with Larry and he is an amazing lecturer who keeps his class engaged with jokes and fun activities. You do have to be there for every lecture\/discussion because you never know when he's going to have a graded in-class worksheet but he doesn't really care if you're not paying attention as long as you don't use any electronics in class. \r\n\r\nHe's also super considerate about assignments and deadlines - he gave extensions on almost all the projects and if you talked to him, then he pretty much gives you as much time as you need to finish the project. His worksheets\/slides\/homeworks\/practice questions are a godsend when you're reviewing for an exam and his project descriptions are super useful when you're trying to come up with edge cases for secret tests (because he literally writes them out for you). \r\n\r\nOne last thing - no release tests! You pass all the public tests, write some student tests if you want, and submit your project. Sometimes, if you submit 48 hours early and only use one submission to pass all the public tests, he gives you extra credit (up to 10 points depending on the project).\r\n\r\nHis class isn't exactly easy but as long as you put the work in, you should do well. Expect to spend 4-6 hours a week in his class if you want to do well.","200":"I did not have good expectations of Larry coming into this course, however so far, he has been one of the best CS instructors i've learned from at UMD. One pro about him is that he provides countless of opportunities to gauge your understanding of the course material through ungraded homeworks and graded worksheets. The worksheets are graded on completion, and are given randomly during lectures and\/or discussions. Another pro is that he provides extremely detailed project descriptions. He is also very kind and helpful in office hours. Highly recommend.","201":"Had Herman for 132 and enjoyed him again for 216. I really just like the way he delivers the course content. It is straightforward, but he also sprinkles some humor to make the class more engaging. I thought his lecture examples were very clear and well detailed, and his exams were pretty fair. Projects were very challenging, but Herman's detailed descriptions helped quite a bit. Overall great INSTRUCTOR and def recommend. ","202":"I've gotta say coming into this semester I was not a huge Herman fan. 1st lecture drops all of these what seems to be outdated stupid rules with a voice that could put you to sleep in seconds, I thought he was going to be the worst. I kept coming back lecture after lecture and I gotta say even though he will bore you to sleep, he is a great lecturer. His code examples and slides are amazing resources, the projects were clear, office hours with him were great, and his occasional humor in his lectures will *sometimes* bring you back to life.\r\n\r\nI'd give him 5 stars if he had gotten things back on time which I'm honestly surprised he hasn't. So far it's a week and a day after the final and I only have 3\/10 of my project grades in and no grade for the final. My A- is a very rough estimate since I don't know how half of my assignments went which is definitely a pretty annoying grievance if you do something incorrect on project 3 for example and continue it up until project 10.\r\n\r\nAnyways, take him if there's no other great options available. As someone who has now had both Pedram and Herman, I would say take Herman. He gives far better exams than Pedram and far better resources to prepare. He very clearly also cares for his students despite his sometimes what seems like random unhinged rules","203":"Honestly one of the more underrated professors in the CS department imo.\r\nHis exams are very fair if you\u2019ve covered the practice exams and the homeworks. \r\nThe projects are usually not too difficult if you start early and reference the example code; the project descriptions are usually very long but I think they do a good job providing all the necessary information so I never felt like anything was too ambiguous.\r\nHe uses worksheets in lectures and discussions to keep track of attendance but they\u2019re largely graded on completion so that\u2019s like free points to me.\r\nHe has his quirks, usually strict about wearing masks and using devices in class. His lectures can also be boring at times but they were recorded so it wasn\u2019t a big deal. Exams are usually given back promptly but we didn\u2019t get back projects until the end of the semester. \r\nUltimately the class structure is fair and Larry gives his students ample opportunity to pass and do good in the class. Highly recommend.\r\n","204":"I\u2019ve taken CMSC131 and 132 with him and he is great. His lectures are good paired with great slides(and are recorded!), cares about students (if you ask him for extensions he will most likely give it if majority needs it), and makes the class enjoyable. He can be annoying sometimes(calling out people a lot) or fooling around, but if you don\u2019t care about that he\u2019s a pretty good lecturer. He gives you past quizzes and exams so you know what to expect on the midterms\/quizzes (not including finals though). His code examples are really good to refer to for projects in 216. In my opinion, if 216 is the only class you\u2019re taking in the summer you shouldn\u2019t be too worried about the projects and exams. Just start early on the projects and do all of the practice he gives you for the exams. If you do that and try, you will at least pass with a B. If you\u2019re willing to get ahead in the summer, I would say go for it.","205":"216 is the only course at UMD that I've taken so far, and it was great. Nelson was awesome, it sucks a bit that the class size was ~120 students, but that's UMD I guess. This class was very fast paced during the summer but Nelson made it manageable.\r\n+ He's funny\r\n+ He's dad\r\n+ He's nice","206":"This guy is the GOAT. He gives practice exams that closely mimic the exam you will be taking. The multiple choice is almost identical and the coding is very similar to the lecture examples and much easier than the projects. The projects are tricky though so make sure to start them early. Lectures are easy to understand and his jokes make class enjoyable. If you don't have an internship in the summerI highly recommend taking this class as he makes this difficult course so much easier. ","207":"*Do not listen to positive reviews of this professor, almost all that are positive are because they have programming experience outside of class. This professor is not worth it for those who are beginners in programming, do not be deceived into taking his class. Please sign up for another professor instead! This is from my perspective as a transfer student. *\r\n\r\nI don't know why everyone says Larry is such a good professor. I took him last semester in my first semester at UMD from transferring from cc. I noticed right away that his lectures are incredibly boring and he is very rude to his students. His overall demeanor comes off very negatively and he doesn't seem friendly like other professors. His projects are insanely long and require you to know practically every word by heart if you want to do well. I would spend entire days doing projects to no avail, and when I came into the office hours I was yelled at instead of helped. His class was an absolute nightmare and was one of the hardest classes I've taken. I think the exams were the worst part by far, they were complete nonsense and there's way too much information crammed into them. Of course he's one of those professors that makes you physically write down code with a pencil and paper which doesn't make sense for a computer science class. Exams have a lot of weight to them and really have a big impact on your grade as well, and they're just too hard for what they are. This class felt like 2 or more classes crammed into one. He assigns way too much work way too quickly, so you will be coding everyday until the class ends. You likely will not have enough time for your other classes while you are taking this class, there will be so much work that you can't divert your attention anywhere else. This class made me switch out of computer science, I'm not sure about the other professors but don't take him if you want to pass and if you want to keep your sanity. Most people in my class dropped quickly and that was the right decision.","208":"Patrick is so helpful! He's really flexible with his hours and cares about students, even outside of the classroom. 100% recommend.","209":"bro pick anybody, not him. When he explains things in class, its really bad. Like id look up YouTube videos on almost every concept. His lectures were really bad and he just doesn't qualify as an effective professor. His exams are a lot more different than other professors, and he doesn't put as much effort into his course as other professors do. If you have the opportunity to pick someone else, do it.","210":"I've only interacted with him a few times in office hours but he is absolutely amazing at helping me with my programs in CMSC216.  This legend is wicked in gdb and showed me how I can run tests in gdb in a matter of minutes without having to recompile my code.  I did have to wait a while in office hours but that is because there were a lot of students, but it was absolutely worth it for him to help me.  Overall great guy!","211":"If you asked me last semester what I would give Larry Herman, I would have said a 2. He essentially makes attending lectures mandatory because of the unannounced classwork. He is a stickler for the rules, like having KN95 mask instead of the generic blue mask (last semester when it was mandatory). He puts a password for all his attachments which is really inconvenient. His projects are probably the hardest among any other classes I have taken and the deadline is not generous (compared to other classes at least). His lectures are extremmmelllllyyyy boring. He essentially didn't curve at all last semester for like the first time because of \"over-performance.\" He doesn't like being called a professor because of the technicalities of the word (lol). I could go on and on about him.\r\n\r\nBut when you take the other CS classes, you'll start to appreciate him. The biggest issue I have with the current CS classes I take is the inconsistencies in practice content and real exam content. The cheating that goes around doesn't make things any better. In this respect, Larry Herman is tough but fair. Occasionally, yes, you'll get a question that you would not know if you strictly did the practice exam, however, this was rare and often would not take you down too much in points. Also, the amount of time he gives for his exams is more than enough. For the final, it seemed like more than half of the people finished early and left.\r\n\r\nAlso, Larry rarely makes grading mistakes, at least not to the degree other professors do. For the current classes, I am taking, to put into perspective, I have to make a regrade request almost every single time. I only had to fix a mistake with him once. \r\n\r\nAdmittedly, as one of the reviewers here pointed out, I have learned programming outside of the class. And if I didn't have prior experience, I probably would not be as successful in this class, or at the least, I would have had to put more effort to achieve the same result. But honestly, if you genuinely have a passion for coding, that is the only way you can possibly succeed in this major for the average person. And if you have a genuine passion for something, you should have prior experience. And even if you are just here pursuing a CS major for the bank, you gotta admit, there is no CS lecturer fairer than Larry Herman. \r\n\r\nOf course, because I mentioned his flaws with him at the beginning, I had to take a star away. I wish he was a bit more lenient in many respects than I listed above; trust me, I'm not happy that he did not curve grades at all when I took 132 with him. But when you advanced further into the CS major, you'll soon come to realize what a privilege it was to learn from a fair person and the things you complained about are minor inconveniences that even have some sense to it (for instance, he wants people to come to class so learning is more effective, hence unannounced classwork). As one person mentioned in my GroupMe recently, \"You don't know what you had until it is gone.\" Don't take Larry Herman for granted.","212":"This guy is awesome","213":"I took Larry in Spring 2022 fearing the worst as he had 3 stars on PlanetTerp. Honestly, he really is a prof- sorry lecturer that is an acquired taste. Some of you will absolutely hate him but I really liked him. His lectures are boring as hell but he is really good at explaining things and he seems like he just wants everyone to succeed. Sure, his pedagogy may be old-fashioned (don't use electronics, always come to class, etc) but the statistics don't lie. Those who came to his class were more likely to get an A. He cracks some really out of pocket jokes sometimes but his jokes keep you from falling asleep. If you go to his office hours he actually is a chill guy, even though he seems like a hardass in lecture. His project descriptions are super detailed and practically tell you how to do the project, which I didn't realize I'd miss so much in CMSC330. The exams were very fair in my opinion and matched the difficulty of the practice exams. The only annoying questions are the multiple choice ones that can give you negative points if you pick the wrong ones. I recommend overall and definitely don't take him for granted.","214":"You better go to his TA hours if you are lost in the sauce.","215":"Like a lot of people mentioned, he has his quirks. Very strict when it comes to certain things and can be a little boring as a lecturer. However, he teaches very well. I learned so much in this class and I felt like he really wanted his students to succeed. I also had to go to his office hours a few times to discuss something unrelated to the course material and he was very nice and accommodating. His exams and grading are also very fair. Projects are fair too with mostly public tests. I would definitely take him again for another class.","216":"Herve is a solid prof. He is new to the CS department, and he has been co-teaching 216 with Yoon this semester. Honestly, his lectures can be a little dry, but he teaches you all the key points (outside of some things you need to go to discussion to in order to learn). From what I've heard, his exams\/quizzes have been much fairer than Yoon's have been. I can't speak for the comparison, but in my experience, the quizzes and exams have been very fair. He obviously wants his students to learn, and takes time to answer student questions thoughtfully.","217":"If you don't consider yourself to be an insanely masterful programmer, then there's not a lot of hope for you with this professor. You quickly realize that going to lecture can actually be detrimental at some times because self studying can get you far further in the course than Yoon can. Prepare to rely on YouTube videos, because trust me when I say there's not a lot you can get from his lectures. He's a nice guy, it's just that I don't really think he's a good professor for a beginner level class that some people take as their first semester in college. Quizzes are unreasonable and difficult, exams aren't too bad but not ideal, and he randomly started taking attendance for discussion halfway through the semester. If you're planning to register with this professor, my best advice is to go with literally anyone else.","218":"Yoon is a great programmer, horrible communicator. He himself can do everything in this class, but you're expected to be at that same level. He started taking attendance for discussions, overlapped assignments, and typos across all of his assignments and quizzes. Made 216 absurdly harder than it needs to be, I had programmed in C\/C++ for 1.5 years at another school but was not ready for this.","219":"Do not go to lecture. He is so badly out of touch with everyone and resorts to obsolete teaching and grading methods to try and make up for having no idea what the average student feels about his course. He is incapable of explaining basic topics in an easy to understand manner. Quizzes and exams test on random bullshit, just be exceedingly familiar with memory and understand the basic mechanics of programming in assembly\/C. \r\n\r\nDO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. I understand that getting the non-yoon professor block is tough. It aint impossible to survive this course, but it unnecessarily, annoyingly hard. \r\nLike others here, I have a lot of experience in many languages, and he is god awful at explaining even basic linux\/C concepts. On the 216 website there is a big PDF of notes on all topics this class will cover, and that will be your holy bible for this class because damn, a few hundred KB pdf is a far better teacher than yoon will ever be. I stopped coming to lecture after the second class.\r\nYour quiz\/exam grade may suck, so be prepared to spend a lot of time on the projects\/excercises, you NEED to nail them. If theres an exercise due a few days after the quiz, stuff on that exercise is fair game on the quiz, which is really stupid, so DO EXERCISES BEFORE THE QUIZ.","220":"Agree with the other review posted. His lectures can be a little bit boring at times but you can tell he cares about you trying to understand what is going on and takes things step by step. He is new and co-teaching with Yoon so I can't speak about how he organizes his classes because he just does what has always been done in 216 at UMD. All of his exams and quizzes have been very fair- if you feel comfortable enough with the material you'll do well. There's no \"gotchas\", just go to class and discussion and make sure you know everything on the slides. He also records lectures which is nice!","221":"Yoon was a very confusing lecturer. I could almost never understand lectures and would have to teach myself everything for the projects and exercises, which was doubled the time I had to spend on the already fast-paced and intensive course. I'm aware that this course is supposed to be hard, but I truly believe that Yoon made it much more difficult for me. It was a really horrible and stressful experience; I would recommend taking a different professor.","222":"I love Larry. People don\u2019t like him because he\u2019s hard, but I enjoyed his lectures. Yes, his tests are hard. And the material is hard, but if you READ THE TEXTBOOK and go to class, you\u2019ll do well. The projects were fun and actually very creative. Definitely recommend taking classes with Larry.","223":"He is one of the best professor I have ever had and he is totally fair. He knows the materials very well and there is always a decent curve on his grades around ten points. He loves his students and never let them go down and if you need him please go to his office hours. His both midterms are long but easy. %50 of the grade is for projects. If you do your project and get around average for your test you can pass the class easily with b\/c . He is talking very very fast but you will get used to it. He tests you on what you know not what you memorize. His hardest project was 4th project and the 5th one..... so do your best on the first 3 ... they are not easy but interesting and doable without any TA's help. He is always on time and on his schedule. he provides solution for all of his tests and quizzes..  he is awesome. I will take a class with him if i can ","224":"He isn't perfect, but there's one reason I'm giving him five stars: I can tell he actually tries to adjust his teaching style as opposed to holding onto how he teaches the course every time. This means that over time, he is going to become an even better professor as he drops things that didn't work and holds on to things that did.\n\r\nFor example, in 2008 someone commented that it was \"purely a slides class.\" A friend who took the course a couple years back also said it was very slide-heavy at the time. This semester, he used the slides sometimes, but didn't teach purely off of the slides. They played more of a supportive role, and oftentimes he didn't even use the slides at all and gave several real-time examples and the like.\n\r\nProjects were kind of a mix. I thought they were mostly fun, but toward the end the public tests dealt with nothing more than basic functionality, which isn't a bad thing, but you have to be aware of it and actually test your code. Practice exams, practice problems, and slides were sufficient for studying for exams, but I had to study pretty hard to get As (according to my browser, I visited the class website 226 times this semester).\n\r\nI know a lot of people care about this, so yes, there was a curve even though the raw mean was a 74.\n\r\nPotential drawbacks: I never asked for an extension in his class, but I did hear he was relatively unaccommodating about them. If you are taking this class at the same time as, say, a class with Meesh, and your life is hard, you should try to finish your assignments for this class on time and ask Meesh for the extension. If you know ahead of time you're going to have a really tough semester for whatever reason, I'd consider holding back on this course until your life clears up a little, if you can afford to.\n\r\ntl;dr not perfect, but good and improving, definitely worth taking","225":"I highly recommend Professor Foster for cmsc330. His lectures are very clear. He enjoys class participation and answers questions very clearly and patiently. The projects are all do-able as long as you don't procrastinate. He's also a genuinely nice guy. There is a reasonable curve at the end of the course so if you're borderline on a grade a bump up is not out of the question. ","226":"Great guy, hard course. This course will work you to death, and then some. Ocaml and Ruby projects are hard, and are nothing (conceptually) like the projects you are used to C, Java, and Assembly. Good luck managing the lengthy projects with the difficult concepts of the class, which also lend themselves to harder exams than in previous CS courses. I wish I wasn't taking 19 credits this semester and could put in more work to get the A in this class, but I am quite satisfied with Foster, he's a genius, and quite possibly the smartest professor I know. \n\r\nSince CMSC330 is required for CS majors and minors, as well as CE majors, there's no way around taking this course, but take it with Foster, you'll learn a lot and feel better about your 400 level's after this course.","227":"He is a very good professor. This class is a bit dry, given it is very theoretical. But despite that, Foster made it quite interesting. He is a very nice guy, answers questions patiently and is an easy grader (decent curve). All material can just be learned from slides. This class is all about projects, where starting early is the key. Strongly recommended with Foster.","228":"Great guy. He did try to make the lectures interesting (considering it's purely a slides class). Projects were for the most part reasonable (and pretty interesting imo). Only exception was the last project he gave. It was difficult and since it was a week before the final it wasn't pretty.\n\r\nExams can be a little tricky and sometimes be a little too long, but nothing terrible.\n\r\nHe is a lenient grader. What I like is he reserves about 3-4% of your final grade as \"class participation\" to bump you up if you did terrible on one project but good on the others. He also doesn't just use cutoffs as a guide, he looks at everyones standings and sees if he can bump them up.\n\n","229":"I've taken Nelson for CMSC216\/CMSC330, and he has to be one of my favorite CS professors. He explains the material well and tries to keep it fun in the process. If you are deciding between Nelson and another professor for a CMSC class - do yourself a favor and take Nelson. You will learn a bunch and have fun in the process. ","230":"I was TA for this course and I had very bitter experience with Prof. Tseng. He has been very mean to TAs, I found him instigating my advisor against me for some minor issue. \n\r\nStay away from this course and this professor.\n\r\nThanks to Prof. Tseng for inspiring me to not join academia after my PhD. ","231":"Although lecture tends to be dry (like most CS courses), Tseng makes up for it by truly being a reliable and helpful professor.\n\r\nExams and quizzes are incredibly fair and he even provides a large amount of practice problems and solutions. Furthermore he's almost always available through email and piazza (the class piazza had a 16 minute response time). I remember once I was up at 1:45am working on a project the same day it was due and he was still up answering questions for us.\n\r\nAlthough class can be boring (and optional if you want to skip and learn on your own via the slides he posts online), prof tseng overall provides a fair course that is truly a breath of fresh air in comparison to 216, 250 and 351 (especially 351...)\n","232":"Tseng is a great professor. I am getting a C, but I take full responsibility for it. If you ever needed help he was more than willing to help. Also, he is very fair with the projects and tests. By far the fairest assignments and projects I've seen in the CS department. \n\r\nWhile lectures can get a bit boring as he does have an unenthusiastic voice, he is very knowledgeable about the material and puts all of the lecture slides online. He speaks clearly and explains himself well.\n\r\nDefinitely recommend him if you have the option.","233":"One of the best CS professors up to this point. He is a blazing fast grader - you will get your exam grades back in 1-2 days usually. There is so much material on the course page, and the exams and quizzes follow the exact format as previous semesters. There is no chance that you will feel underprepared for an exam or quiz if you do the practice material. The exams are graded fairly for the most part.\n\r\nHe is also very nice and helpful - he checks Piazza very frequently and answers EVERY. SINGLE. QUESTION. that students post, or at least endorses a correct student answer.\n\r\nThe projects are mostly fair. They are harder and take more time than 216 projects, but they are manageable if you start a good time in advance. A good portion of the projects are put in the secret tests, unfortunately.\n\r\nAs for the lectures, they are not extremely useful since he posts all his slides online. I don't bother going to discussion unless taking a quiz.","234":"Some people like good lecturers, but I liked the fact that I could appropriate class time to do more productive things, like sleep. All the tools to get an A are on the class page (slides, practice problems, past exams). \n\r\nAlso, it benefits you to start the project early since a couple of times we had quizzes and exams before a project was due. A couple of times I regretted focusing on the quizzes\/exams then the projects because I then realized I would've been pro at the material if I had just worked on the project first.","235":"Tseng is a pretty good professor, but his lectures are nothing special. The amount of material he distributes on the class website is ridiculous. In addition to all the slides from class and discussion, he posts practice quizzes\/exams, the previous 4 versions of the quiz\/exam, and general practice questions for each subject before every quiz\/exam. He's an accommodating guy; just make sure to take the quizzes and exams seriously, because they cover a lot and are a bit part of the grade.","236":"The class doesn't really require a teacher because it's mostly just about learning the programming languages. There are a few more advanced concepts that Tseng explained decently. The projects take up a lot of time, but you will learn a lot from them. And at the end of the semester the projects die down significantly, which is nice because it gives you a chance to put in more time for your other classes. Some of the projects can be extremely frustrating though, especially when he doesn't give you an easy way to test them. For example, to test your code for one of our projects would have required days of writing out test inputs and figuring out their correct outputs. But even if you fail one project, it's still possible to get an A. Anyway, I'd say Tseng was fine for this class.","237":"Chau-wen taught this class with Foster, who seemed to think that all of us were geniuses. Chau-Wen seemed to be the weaker prof of the two. Foster controlled the primary parts of the exams and projects. He turned simples project into massive, tedious projects. So far in the semester, at least half the students never even finish the projects. As a teacher, he is not the most amazing teacher ever. He simply reads off the slides, and I never go to class because of it anymore.\n\r\nI don't know why they decided to make the projects so hard for us this semester. This class definitely isnt as easy as it used to be. It's much harder mostly because of the projects. I'm taking this class simultaneously with 311 and it's a living hell. Whatever you do, do NOT take this class with another programming class. Take something like 351 or a decent 400 level class instead.","238":"Passable via the power points as I don't remember attending any lectures after the first week. Midterms didn't fit a nice difficulty\/length ratio. Curve was appropriate however. Projects were easy. The final was easy if you studied previous\/practice exams and the power points carefully.","239":"Chau-Wen's class was....an interesting experience. Like many CS teachers, he is an expert in his area of research and really knows what he's talking about, but he ocassionally struggles in conveying this information to students who know nothing about it to begin with.\n\r\nHis tests were probably his greatest weakness. They had good coverage of the required material, but the combination of the tests being both too long and having extremely challenging problems made them pretty much impossible to finish.\n\r\nTowards the end of the semester, he started to deviate from his own syllabus, but this was both good and bad. Instead of giving us Java projects at the end as originally planned, he instead put more focus into new programming languages, which proved to be helpful since Java had already been covered to a great detail in previous classes. \n\r\nThe grades for the class were pretty low throughout the semester and many people were worried, but Chau-Wen had a pretty nice curve at the end.","240":"His lecture were long and probably the most boring I ever been in. His exams covered so much material and it was impossible for even the smart kids in the class to finish. He also did not stick to the syllabus.","241":"He gives you very detailed powerpoint notes that he posts online. I didn't have to take notes. He gave us good review materials for all the exams. The projects were reasonable. Overall he was a pretty good professor although lectures weren't too exciting...but how many comp sci lectures are?","242":"I can understand the people who really dislike him, because he can be quite harsh. However, in the end he is quite competent as a teacher, and provides good resources online through worksheets and slides. He also teaches pretty well. If you have to take him over a mediocre professor, it'll be fine as long as you use the resources available.","243":"Lecture: \r\nDr. Hicks rarely used the lecture slides, but posted them online. Most of lecture was going over the concepts and answering questions, he likes questions. \n\r\nProjects:\r\nWe had 5 projects, 2 with Ruby, 2 with Ocaml and 1 using Prolog. Overall they were pretty difficult, except for the first project, it wasn't very hard, but was very long. You really need to start the projects within a couple days of them being due, the concepts are more theoretical in this class, in 131\/132\/216 everything was fairly straightforward. \n\r\nDiscussion:\r\nWe had 5 quizzes (announced) and they were generally on the easy side, just testing basic knowledge of what was going on during lecture. I had Richard Johnson as my TA, he was very helpful.\r\nNo discussion programming projects. \n\r\nExams:\r\nWe had one exam on Ruby\/NFA\/DFA\/Regex\/CFG and maybe some other stuff. This exam was pretty straightforward and easy. The second midterm was on Ocaml\/Operational Sematics\/Multithreading, this exam was pretty hard. The final was a little easier than the second exam.\n\n","244":"Professor Hicks is, in my opinion, one of the best professors the computer science department has to offer. He is interactive and engaging with students by focusing more on sample code and examples generated in class rather than simply reading off the lecture slides. He even makes the boring material seem interesting. Also, he is very receptive to his students and will try to answer most questions in class, or will come back the next lecture with a solution to a question. Hicks focuses his material around student needs rather then curriculum requirements. I really enjoyed his CMSC330 class, and though it was very difficult, in my opinion, his teaching style was very effective and helpful. I will definitely be taking other classes with this professor including CMSC433. Highly Recommended!!","245":"Professor Hicks spends the lecture showing examples of code (which he generates during lecture) of what he tries to teach, while also posting lecture slides (which he doesn't really use in class).\n\r\nUltimately, I found this style really helpful. It promotes attendance and understanding because you get to see the concepts in action if you attend class, but you also have the slides to refer back to.\n\r\nI enjoyed Hicks as a professor and plan to have him as a professor again.","246":"Very good teacher, you will definitely learn a lot from him. He keeps class light and interesting, constantly forces class members to go up to the board and do examples. Makes sure you're learning and not just losing him. Also VERY approachable.\n\r\nThe drawback I had were his tests. If you want to do well on his tests, be prepared to hang around his office every day and do tons and TONS of extra problems. The average grade on our first test was something like a 28. His TAs were also really good, but there were several problems with  project descriptions\/testing (which the TAs were in charge of). It was all resolved, however, and they were generally lenient when they messed up.\n\r\nOverall, Id certainly recommend this guy.","247":"He's a great professor. I had him for CMSC330, and he tells good jokes, keeps class interesting, and is an effective teacher. I really felt like a learned a *lot* in the course, and the class will probably be very useful to things I do in the future. During the semester, I only missed one lecture (and I wish I didn't even miss that one), because the lectures were always engaging and informative.\n\r\nThe one drawback is that he does not use the grades server, but this is a minor one. He is very approachable. Highly recommended.","248":"I had cmsc330 with Anwar and between him and Hicks\/Foster, he's probably the worst professor to take for this class. Anwar is a cool dude, but his lectures were terrible and he moves at a pace that was too fast for most students to catch everything. His explanations are less than clear, and I soon ended up watching Hick's online lectures to try and get the rest of the material.\r\n\r\nThere were two midterms, fairly tricky but not too bad. Both of them were pretty long, and took the full 75 mins right up to the line - they really pack the exams. Definitely study the exams from previous semesters and drill ocaml\/prolog programming if you want to do well on these.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it's actually an awesome class and the material is really interesting despite the workload. I felt pretty solid in my standing as a software eng. after this class, because a lot of concepts across different languages kinda clicked for me. Get Cameron Moy as your TA if you can :) Good luck!","249":"Mamat is a very accommodating professor, but his lectures are completely worthless. On more than one occasion, he would explain the material in the first 45 minutes while barely moving through the slides, and then rapidly go through them, only doing quizzes AND SOMETIMES SKIPPING IMPORTANT THINGS ALTOGETHER! \r\nFortunately, if Foster\/another professor posts their lectures online, the class will be a breeze. Also, the project descriptions are very easy to understand, and the public tests are usually pretty robust, which is great especially if you're used to Nelson's \"figure it out if you can\" approach.\r\nI like the guy, but I didn't attend lecture after the first month and still got an A on the final just by reading slides and doing projects. That pretty much sums up how important his lectures are right there. ","250":"The lectures were way too fast and not engaging. By the end of the semester, I was skipping class and watching Foster\u2019s lectures online. The tests and projects were fair, although we were left to just figure out basic SQL on the last one, which was annoying. The class itself is an interesting one, and old tests are provided for study. It\u2019s certainly not the end of the world or anything if you have Mamat, you\u2019ll still learn things, just probably not as much as if you had Foster.","251":"Super friendly guy. Lectures can be super fucking confusing (at least if he is teaching 330). He's a reasonable option for any class. With the curve, I got a B- and finished the class with a 77%. So that alone is worth having him for.","252":"A solid okay. Handwriting terrible but a pretty nice guy. Great at teaching discussion not so good for office hours","253":"Great TA, very hardworking. Will answer your questions swiftly.","254":"This guy really knows his stuff! So nice and very easy to follow. ","255":"Enjoyable and always seems to be in a good mood. She is clearly so smart and her class is straight forward, co-taught with Gilray and an enjoyable lecture. No complaints!","256":"what the heck is wrong with this dude. He goes over his lectures really fast. Cannot take notes and cannot understand anything. ","257":"Lecture:\r\nProf. Hicks uses slides mostly as an outline, and occasionally uses the whiteboard as well. In some cases he edits a slide temporarily for examples. He's really helpful in clarifying concepts to those who ask.\r\n\r\nAs of spring 2018, Prolog is being replaced by Rust in 330. I believe Dr. Hicks had a major role in this decision, and for that I'm bumping this to 5 stars. \r\n\r\nWhile I didn't find the material too challenging or interesting, going to lecture did not feel like a chore at all. ","258":"Goes over slides pretty quickly, but he is pretty engaging in my opinion. Just sit in the front. ","259":"He was very energetic and amazing. Learned all of the material from him and not the professor. AMAZING TA","260":"She can be a little difficult to understand at times, but it is nothing compared to other TAs and professors I've had in the past.  She is very knowledgeable about the content covered in the course despite this semester being the first time she taught 330.  Honestly, she is a fine lecturer and if for whatever reason you don't find it enjoyable, you can always watch the recorded lecturers from other professors or even go to their lecture instead.  My biggest gripe with her lecture was not her, but the incredibly rude students who would often talk loudly with one another while she was talking!  If I could give her any advice, it would be to lay down the law and tell those people outright to shut up.","261":"He is extremely engaging and I honestly understood the material so well after. He goes fast but the slides are online so you can just note what he says. I'm a visual learner and he's the best at explaining through code examples that he writes on the spot. I would say he is definitely a better professor to have for 330. ","262":"Great lecturer - he's very clear and easy to understand. He wants the best for his students. If you reach out to him when the workload is unreasonable, he will try to adjust the coursework\/scores accordingly to help his students succeed. However, do not expect him to help you if you are slacking.","263":"he teachs the concept pretty well, although the coding question he gives on exam are hard","264":"While I'm preparing to fail this class, I know it is 100% not the fault of this TA. Not only is he extremely smart (causally mentions interviewing with Google [goosh]) he brings memes to the class room. This reassures that the class room is not only a place to grow mentally but a place a grow our connection to the course through humor. The memes were the only beam of light in this course. \r\n\r\nHonestly though, the man is intelligent and helpful. I personally thought he was pretty funny, as well. At times, he did a better job then the main teacher. Thanks Shriraj! Sorry I didn't know your name til week 10. ","265":"Hes' really nice and doesn't go too fast. Somehow made going to his 8am lecture worth it (lol rip). He hates clickers just as much as us and tried to make it as painless as possible (sometimes just straight up gave us the answers). Really sympathetic to students and the undergrad struggles. Love the dude. Would take a course with him again.","266":"Anwar is a pretty good lecturer and incredibly funny. His exams are fair, the average my semester was an 80% on the nose. The only valid gripe people have with him is the pacing of his lectures. He does tend to fly through some of the material on the slides, but if you try to pay attention, you'll be fine. Even moreso, all of his lectures are online, and his lectures are recorded and put online in case you missed them, so you should be fine. The projects will be more challenging than the ones you have had so far in 132 and 216 because you will be forced to navigate through different languages and different concepts, but for the most part, you will survive. \r\n\r\nPeople have gripes with him for having clicker questions that force you to come to lecture, but that really isn't criticism, because you should come to lecture anyway and he's giving you easy points that'll bump your grade at the end of the semester. \r\n\r\nAll around a nice professor and person, and I definitely recommend you take 330 with Anwar. I've never had Eastman, but I hear he's ok too. ","267":"Anwar is not a terrible instructor, but not great either. He mostly reads off the slides and often rushes through topics. He tells a lot of stories and goes on a lot of tangents, which would be fine if it didn't mean rushing through challenging topics. I often felt like I didn't learn much by going to lecture and wished I didn't need to go, but there are clicker questions in order to enforce attendance. The material itself is very cool and the TAs for 330 are phenomenal. Also, Hicks is supposedly incredible, so if he's an option, take him. Otherwise, you'll be OK with Anwar, you just might need to put in a little extra time and effort.","268":"Decent lecturer, although he goes a bit fast at times. He is a nice guy and has some funny stories. ","269":"okay, he's chill and nice and all, but my god i cannot pay attention during any of his lectures. 330 is a fast paced class in general and if you don't pay attention for one second you'll get swept away and won't understand the rest of the lecture. on top of that he sometimes doesnt explain concepts properly and just explains them in a very broad sense. i mean he's not the worst professor but i really did not like his teaching style, but who knows maybe that's just the way 330 is","270":"He's a great TA, and very understanding if you have a tight situation. He has been a TA for 330 for quite a while so he knows his stuff very well. If you have him as a TA you should be fine.b ","271":"He's a very good professor. He also has a good sense of humor and usually conveys topics well.\r\n\r\nI thought the projects were difficult and they caused me a lot of stress. Having a good TA helped for many of the projects.\r\n\r\nIf it is relevant, he definitely has big gamer energy (for one, he teaches the game programming class, and for two, he's talked about playing 2000 Quake, so you know he's an OG Gamer).","272":"Solid guy but not a good lecturer. Reads off slides. Lectures are so useless but attendance is mandatory via clickers. Slides are good.","273":"He makes the exams and the class as easy as possible. he is a fun lecturer in comparison to others. ","274":"Good stuff, informative slides. Nice guy, good professor. Super easy exams when he helps to make it. Sometimes lectures can get long and slow to cover. Good thing he records his lectures so I can watch it at 2x speed after!","275":"He's your average professor that goes off the slides and tries to go into detail into explaining the concepts. His pace is slow but is ineffective at teaching the material. He co-teaches with Anwar so the material would be the same, luckily his lectures were recorded. Still needed to go for clicker questions though. His project descriptions were horrible, that the piazza is flooded with questions on clarity all the time. ","276":"Really nice during office hours. Does not sound condescending nor mean and he answers questions clearly.","277":"Anwar flies through the material very quickly, but that's just because there's a lot of stuff to cover. This semester he managed the online transition due to the pandemic quite well, and he toned down the amount of work we had to do. The slides really are the primary resource in the class, so study those, look at them when doing projects, and you'll do great!","278":"Dr. Eastman\u2019s a really nice guy, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a really good professor.\r\nHe\u2019s a little bit disorganized, and sometimes when he lectures it seems like he\u2019s seeing the slides for the first time (usually it\u2019s Prof. Mamat\u2019s slides but just tweaked a little bit). Sometimes, albeit rarely,  if you ask him a question in class about Ruby or OCaml, he\u2019d respond vaguely and say that he doesn\u2019t code much in those languages, which is understandable but makes me uneasy. Also sometimes on projects you have to use things he skimmed over in lecture\/haven\u2019t learned (but Mamat\u2019s class did go over).\r\nThankfully, Mamat puts up a whole bunch of practice quizzes\/exams on the class webpage, and they rarely deviate from the real thing. Also start projects super early. If you get stuck just look at discussion code from github, they\u2019re pretty similar to most of the projects.\r\nIf you wanna learn something, I\u2019d suggest taking Mamat, but if you want a laid back environment, I\u2019d choose Eastman. But since they co-teach, I feel like you\u2019re sorta at  a disadvantage with Eastman.","279":"Dr. Eastman is a good lecturer who is knowledgeable about the topics that he teaches. While this class is tough, Dr. Eastman helps you understand the theory of everything you need to know. In addition, he is friendly and approachable, so if you have any questions about the course content, you can go to his office hours for further understanding. He is a good CMSC 330 instructor.","280":"Dr. Eastman is the best CS professor!! I would love to take more classes with him, but he doesn't teach that many courses. I took 330 with him, and he was great!!","281":"DVH is a good professor, but somewhat unremarkable. His lectures are kinda dry, but maybe that's just because we were online. The projects were interesting and fun, and overall I enjoyed this class.","282":"Not a good lecturer, because he goes super fast over complicated material, and could be a bit more civil, but that's really the only main complaint.  Clicker questions are not the worst and his slides are very comprehensive, the projects are fairly reasonable to do (better than 216's for sure) and the exams were fair too. Nothing completely out of the blue. Some TAs were really really helpful too and were responsive on Piazza. Overall, since 330 is usually co-taught, you should be fine taking either Anwar or the other professor. ","283":"DVH is a decent lecturer, but is very monotone, though I didn't mind that personally. \r\n\r\nNot much more to say except that I disliked having graded clicker quizzes. If you don't attend lecture the onus is on you to know the material, but you shouldn't be punished with a 0 on the clicker quizzes on top of that. But YMMV.","284":"He is boring but the content is fine. He doesn't really care much about his students but the TAs are awesome. Start projects the day they are posted and you will be in good shape. ","285":"David Van Horn is clearly incredibly knowledgable on the topics that he teaches, however, his lectures are rather dull and lacking on student engagement. If you're able to focus through his lectures, you will do a great job, but I often found that I would zone out at some point and then fall behind his fast-paced lectures entirely and resort to watching Anwar's lectures instead. The class as a whole is easy if you put the time in, but that being said the work is constant and unrelenting, the expectations are high, and if you fall behind you will have a very hard time catching up.","286":"Ashan was always a great TA and he was always really helpful during office hours. ","287":"His lecture is boring, and you wouldn't understand anything. Anwar Mamat is way better ","288":"The class is pretty chill, but I have a feeling he lectures way too quickly to try and cover alot of material. ","289":"goes above and beyond to help students, you could say he'd be willing to take a trip to the moon and back to help you out. best TA ever!","290":"Anwar manages to keep the lecture engaging and entertaining the whole class, he's a great professor and I have no dought I would have received a higher grade had I taken this class in-person. Genuine guy who really cares about his students and offers them a lot of resources and opportunities to ask for help in office hours. ","291":"Hicks lectures very quickly, but is willing to field every question.  Project expectations and due dates were clear and fair, although some of them could be quite time consuming. Exams were easy enough and from lecture, and quizzes were announced and were challenging.","292":"Had him for CMSC132 and had to take him again because he's great. Would take another class with him if I could.","293":"He's great! Goes very fast but at least for 330, everything you need to know is on the slides anyway.","294":"Dr. Hicks is nice enough but lectures too quickly IMHO. Maybe he was different before COVID tho. The TA's however are amazing, especially Shilpa, and got me through projects, quizzes, and exams. Projects are difficult but not too bad if you start early. My advice, watch the discussion videos","295":"This professor was very good. He made sure that everything you needed to know was in the lecture slides. Make sure to follow what he is teaching and do the practice that he puts up and you will be fine. The assignments are tough if you do not both to learn\/practice the material that he is teaching. As a teacher he seems to genuily enjoy teaching the students and it was a breath of fresh air compared to other professors here.","296":"Dr. Eastman was pretty good. His lectures were kinda dry but he explained things decently well. He made extra videos out of lecture on topics that confused students, so that was really nice to see.\r\nIf you're taking 330 with Eastman, you'll be fine.","297":"Eastman is a really nice professor who is extremely approachable. However, I did feel like the class was kind of disorganized. Sometimes while lecturing it would seem like he was reading the slides for the first time, which made things hard to follow. However, I think that the class was pretty easy to follow and the content was taught in an understandable manner. I took the class in Spring 2020, so the unplanned transition to online definitely contributed to the lack of organization.","298":"Very good professor. Extremely approachable and nice to talk to. His class isnt challenging tbh. All the projects were pretty straightforward, with most of the later ones being all public and semi public. The exams were pretty fair too, if i paid more attention in lecture and had a better TA in discussion I probably would have gotten an A in the class.","299":"Eastman is a nice guy who wants to see you succeed. He is willing to spend significant time trying to help you in office hours. \r\n\r\nHowever, he is, in my opinion, a very boring and slow lecturer. It seemed to me like he had never seen the slides before trying to present them in class, and we frequently found ourselves far behind Mamat's classes because he did not cover content or answer student questions efficiently. He would reexplain half the lecture even if a student's question could be answered in a sentence. \r\n\r\nAssignments were generally not too hard. There is a lot of variation in the TA quality, but office hours can be a big help. Some of the exams were a bit challenging in terms of time but the content isn't too bad.","300":"Eastman is a very nice and approachable professor. However, his lectures were pretty boring, disorganized, and not very engaging. We also frequently fell behind Mamat's section of this class due to Eastman's slow pace during lecture. Exams were generally OK (except for the final, in my opinion) and the projects were straightforward. Office hours were a big help for solving project issues and clearing up questions from lecture. The TAs vary a lot in quality - I benefited from having a good TA for my discussion section, but this isn't universally the case. ","301":"Not sure why he gets so much hype. Would not recommend taking him if you can take the other prof for 330 (assuming he's co teaching with a good prof....I think I heard Anwar is leaving so I can't tell you to take it with Anwar lol). He's tried to improve his lecture skills (he mentioned that he's heard he \"only reads off the slides\") but as the semester went on, he seemed to just drift back to his old ways. Often did not seem prepared for lecture. Fell behind Anwar as other reviews say. The projects and exams were good, but the projects are old so idk how much Eastman contributed to them. Exams were fine and were online except the final. No clicker quizzes which was really nice. They planned to replace clicker quizzes with weekly ELMS quizzes but only ended up doing two. Anyway, if he's co-teaching, I would recommend going with the prof that seems to actually take care of the course materials (by this I mean Anwar made the \"textbook\" slides and Eastman modified them, so for Eastman vs. Anwar I would go with Anwar). ","302":"I guess Anwar's gone now, but in case he comes back...\r\n\r\nI would say he's a good lecturer. My main complaint would be that he never really slows down. We would go through a huge amount of slides everyday and sometimes it seemed like he was racing. 330 has a lot of content, so that's probably why. I don't personally take notes, but I don't think anyone could with how fast he goes. He still did a good job at explaining concepts and the slides were well made, so you could basically just study off of those. He was clearly frustrated this semester by the turnout in lecture. Clicker quizzes used to be 4% of the grade, basically making lecture attendance mandatory. They changed the policy in the first week of the semester I believe, since people could be in and out with COVID. He would make lots of comments to himself during lecture about how it's so hard to teach this semester with not that many people in lecture and with everyone wearing masks. I also guess that computers used to not be allowed in 330 lecture, but now they are? He would complain about people having computers out too sometimes, and how he couldn't do anything.\r\n\r\nThe projects in this class weren't very difficult, except for the NFA to DFA project and maybe the first OCaml project. If you start early, you should be fine. There were two online midterms which were pretty fair. We had four 20 minute online quizzes in the semester that I found to be very difficult. 20 minutes was not enough time and they seemed a bit unnecessary (the last quiz was on a topic on the last midterm, which was a week before). The final was also in-person for some reason. People would complain on Piazza and the TAs said that the decision was made by the instructors. People tried to ask Mamat\/Eastman to change it to in-person and they said they would think about, but they did nothing. Not a good look on their part, considering the online midterms were open book and this wasn't. Plus, many people expressed COVID concerns due to a in-person final, which was also ignored.\r\n\r\nAll in all, if Anwar comes back, I would recommend him. I was planning on taking 433 with him, but they changed teachers. He seems to have been a bit disillusioned by teaching this semester by all his comments on lecture, but I do hope he comes back.","303":"In the Fall 2021 semester, Cliff Bakalian was the new instructor for CMSC250, and many of my friends who took him left with very positive impressions. Because of this, when I saw his name listed on Testudo for CMSC330 the following semester, I was very excited to sign up for his lecture section and learn more about the organization of programming languages. Unfortunately, I was left rather disappointed.\r\n\r\nCMSC330 is a very content-heavy class - the sheer amount of information being packed into a single week is astounding. However, students have already taken or gotten credit for CMSC131, CMSC132, and CMSC216 by this point, so learning new material should not be a foreign experience. Sadly, Cliff's lecture style left something to be desired. He usually seemed to prioritize covering as many slides as possible as opposed to focusing on the fundamentals. For example, one week we had a PowerPoint nearly 70 slides long - Cliff blasted through as fast as he could, and many of the pertinent examples provided he would go \"I don't care about this,\" and skip straight past them. Consequently, by the time we got to more complicated topics, I was lost and confused as we didn't spend enough time on the fundamentals.\r\n\r\nI stopped going to his lectures about a month into the semester and decided to watch Professor Van Horn's recordings instead - while he could be monotonous at times, he took much more care with the material, and besides, there are a great number of very helpful TAs both in in-person and online office hours, so I got by that way.\r\n\r\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend taking CMSC330 with Cliff unless you can absorb lots of material very quickly. At least he responds to questions effectively.","304":"While I don't vibe with his lecturing style, Cliff is a very knowledgeable and nice professor! I had external issues this semester and was really scared to talk to him about it, but he didn't ask any questions and was extremely understanding-- more so than I thought any professor here would be. He obviously cares about the class content and students. He's new to teaching and has said he's constantly thinking of how to change the class for the better, so I think he'll only improve from here. If he's an option, definitely take him :) ","305":"Took him for CMSC250 his first semester teaching, and had a pretty decent experience. The class was mostly organized and he knew the content pretty well.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately 330 this semester wasn't the same. While the class was organized well, cliffs lectures were very difficult to follow along with. He seemed to not be interested in the material, and would speed through content and wouldn't\/struggled to break down complex topics. This was especially a problem when it came to Rust, which is pretty complex and we covered in the last 3 weeks of the semester. I went to almost all lectures this year, and for each I found myself feeling disengaged with the content. I found myself learning most of the content by carefully reading the lecture slides after the lecture was over, and looking at outside resources.\r\n\r\nAll in all cliff is a great guy and clearly cares about his students, but his lectures weren't up to what I was expecting for a CS course.","306":"Cliff skips over important material in lectures, paces poorly, and does not truly attempt to check for understanding among the class. When nobody raises their hand to answer his lecture quiz questions, it would suggest that few are following the material. The class was still not particularly difficult, considering that exams were online and very fair. Watching David Van Horn's lecture videos were also great for getting up to speed. Cliff's lectures, however, are inadequate for engaging with the important material in this class. TLDR; the TAs and Van Horn's videos carried me through this class; would not currently recommend Cliff","307":"extremely cool and also based professor. do not listen to the other girls. he slays too hard.","308":"Cliff is generally a great guy and a pretty solid professor. He's very approachable and definitely tries his best to make the class interactive though it can be difficult given the lack of participation sometimes. He showed examples in REPls like irb and utop and I came out of lecturers feeling like I knew the content well. His style of drawing things out when they're complicated and showing examples in that manner gave some depth to his teaching that I really appreciated, especially in the finite automata units. Though I sometimes felt like the content was a bit dry, I found him to be a more than good professor. The exams and quizzes being online were also very nice.","309":"I stopped going to his lectures and went to DVH's instead. In hindsight it was the right move as I went from having a 100% success rate of falling asleep in class to actually paying attention. I will say Cliff seems like a really chill guy and is approachable, however, I felt like he wasn't that interested with the content of 330, hence really dry lectures. Most of the material can be found on the slides or recordings so there's no need to show up. Exams were very fair. Projects weren't terrible(don't go to office hours last second). Quizzes were tough in terms of limited time, but doable. ","310":"Very nice guy, I think that's evident based on all the reviews, and if you take any course he teaches you will feel the same.\r\n\r\nI feel like the reviews given for him for CMSC250 don't represent him as well. I had him last semester and got an A-, but he was pretty amazing for me. He did speak in a monotone manner though, which can be easily to cause you to daze a bit. People were saying he only has good reviews because he was co-teaching with Justin, but Cliff made his own slides for CMSC250 last semester and taught his own way, so I do feel he's being slandered a bit. Maybe it was because he was the main one to manage CMSC250 and Justin was the main one to manage it last semester, and if that's what people meant, then I suppose so. I felt he did great overall, but maybe this semester is different. I can't speak on that because I didn't take CMSC250 with him this semester, so my opinion may not be as valid as the others, although I feel the other reviews may be a bit over-exaggerated. \r\n\r\nIn terms of CMSC330 though, he was pretty solid too. Not as much as 250 for me last semester, but he was still pretty good. He's very understanding as well. He doesn't question anything, as once I showed him what a TA said on a regrade request on my exam and fixed it on the spot, and he has a lot of sympathy for students. Sometimes he does get thrown off on a slide and gets confused or something, and sometimes he does blatantly read off the slides so going to lecture may not be optimal (he had lecture quizzes online so some people didn't really go to lecture, including me to be honest). The slides posted online helped me navigate through CMSC330 and helped build an understanding for each unit\/topic we covered, along with understanding the whole purpose of the course. Sure, it may not be hard to post slides or he might have recycled them, but at the end of the day all the professor has to do is deliver information and make sure you understand it, and I felt like he accomplished that. The exams, quizzes, lecture quizzes, and projects of course were all online and open-note\/internet as well, making it less stressful for students too.\r\n\r\nOverall, it was hard for me to pay attention in lecture at times, but that's just me. I sometimes even daze off even in Justin's lecture. Sometimes Cliff's lectures felt like \"I can just look at the slides when he posts them\", but then that turns into \"I have to look at 15 slides the day before an exam\" which i found myself doing a decent bit lol. I didn't give him a 5 star because his lectures are somewhat dull because he's monotone, and that makes it harder to pay attention, especially when you're already lost on some topic. He's very sympathetic, and has great potential to be a great professor though. Currently, I'd give him 4 stars, and for the future when he adjusts to lecturing, managing and leading courses, and overall improve over time, I'd say he's easily at-least a 4.5 star. ","311":"The class pacing was fast but at the same time, I didn't want to learn the content because it was so uninteresting. In class, I did barely anything and I just looked at the slides during the lecture quizzes to learn the material for the day. He just seemed so tired after teaching CMSC250 that he didn't feel like teaching 330 at all. Seems like people were not fans of cmsc250 either. My TA was great though.","312":"Class lectures were a bit dry, though I would also blame the extremely dense powerpoints given for 330. While Cliff did at times do a good job explaining concepts to students and making sure to answer any questions, I ended up learning more by going to outside sources, and by doing the lecture quizzes and projects required for the course. Cliff definitely does care about his students though, and I don't think you'd do poorly if you had him as a professor.","313":"Chill guy, nothing wrong with his teaching per say. He mainly seemed uninterested in teaching, and had zero enthusiasm when lecturing. Didn't really go into a lot of detail when doing example problems in lecture, and I had a hard time not falling asleep. Exams and projects were manageable. For projects just start early and got to OH asap if you are stuck.","314":"I understand this is an accelerated summer class, that said some of the expectations made in this course were simply unacceptable.\r\n\r\nI found it quite obnoxious when Cliff would say we have 10 days for a project then proceed to wait a week before teaching us all the content needed for said project.\r\nThe projects were honestly a pain. Some of the requirements felt more like tick questions designed to frustrate us rather than to actually display what we learned. \r\n\r\nThat said lectures don\u2019t get uploaded during the weekend; perhaps Cliff also needs a break over the weekend; however it would be nice to have something to reference when we have projects to work on over the weekends. \r\n\r\nIn any case, Cliffs lecturer's examples were usually inadequate and not clear; they were not a good foundation for these projects. \r\n\r\nThe difficulty between what we learn in class and the projects is too large of a jump, perhaps it\u2019s not that surprising considering they are just reused projects from other professors, who gave weeks to work on the same projects we are given 6 days for.\r\n\r\nThe lecture quizzes were quite a headache. The slides don\u2019t get uploaded the same day and so we are basically expected to just retain everything we had learned that day.\r\n\r\nThe exams weren\u2019t great and averages weren\u2019t very good. We were provided older exams to reference; however working on projects consumed way too much time away from studying. A Lot of us had to make a choice between getting the project done or studying. Even now at this moment we have a 4 part project due Friday the same day as our final worth 27% of our grade. I must seriously question if anyone would find this reasonable.\r\n\r\nThe class honesty left me feeling helpless at times, there needs to be more reasonable standards for projects and adequate time allocated on par with what we learn. I believe Cliff does care about these students but he needs to sort of look at things on our level and set reasonable expectations. \r\n\r\n","315":"Just took CMSC330 with Cliff over the summer.\r\nThe main issue with Cliff has been with his structure and administration of the course. Unclear deadlines and typos in assignments, quizzes, and slides were extremely commonplace when taking this course. Even what material we were going to cover over the condensed course was questioned a lot by the instructors and TAs. At one point, they even outright lied (probably not intentionally) about what was going to be covered\/not covered on the final exam. All of this had a direct impact on the class, and this run of CMSC330 had some of the lowest exam averages on record (the class was curved substantially to make up for this). Apparently, this was due to Cliff somehow not being told that the course was going to only be 6 weeks long instead of 12 weeks long, but I digress.\r\n\r\nAs a lecturer, Cliff was not the worst. He typed things out in Vim to demonstrate concepts, but he went fast and it was largely hit or miss if this approach beat out just sticking to dense slides. For instance, typing out code in Vim made sense, but once we got to NFAs\/DFAs and grammars... Why not use whiteboarding software instead? One plus is that he'd post \"Lecture Recap\" videos for each lecture for those who couldn't make it to class. Although, these videos would often be posted 3-5 days after the lecture they covered, so relying on them to keep up is ill advised.\r\n\r\nWhile I didn't personally go to in person office hours (both in person and online OH were offered), those who did described the TAs as \"rude\" and \"bothered by questions.\" This doesn't affect my evaluation of Cliff himself, but I felt that it was worth mentioning and pointing out that this is unacceptable behavior for TAs.\r\n\r\nOverall, I would still recommend taking courses with Cliff over many alternatives simply due to his approachable nature as well as his modern online approach to teaching. He is still young and can only improve with experience and I believe Cliff has the potential to be a good professor. He cares and is accommodating to students, but as of now, he still has a way to go (and needs new TAs) before being truly exceptional.\r\nOh, and his hair was stunning.","316":"I never feel prepared for the lecture quizzes despite paying close attention during lecture and reviewing after. His teaching style is confusing and he only shows examples but doesn't really introduce things. So when there is a question to do a certain operation on something, I don't know what to do because he never said the name of that operation in class. Also, the lecture quiz questions are harder than the examples we did in class. I heard a lot of good things about Jose so I was really looking forward to taking this class with him, but I am left feeling confused after every lecture quiz which is very frustrating. Projects are very fair especially with help from the more accountable TAs, and yes, Jose is engaging and passionate so I'll still give him 4 stars. But I wish there was more organization to his lectures, and I doubt I would be doing as well as I am now if I was also taking CMSC351 at the same time which most people do.","317":"I mustve gotten unlucky or something this semester but Jose has generally been pretty bad. The first average on the exam was a 64% and 70% of the class got caught cheating on it (it was take-home). He focuses too much on the abstractness of a concept and doesn't teach us what we actually need to know. It kinda makes him seem like a smartass. The class is cotaught with Cliff and a lot of the stuff on the lecture quizzes are from Cliff's lectures and are never talked about in Jose's lecture. I was excited to take Jose but I will never register for him again. He is a nice guy but he just seems burnt out from lecturing or something.","318":"I think his teaching style for this class is an acquired taste. He doesn't use slides, but instead handwrites on a piece of paper as he explains a concept. Before last week, he had a problem of not saying the name of a concept he taught so when we got the lecture quiz we were all confused. However, he is very receptive to changing his teaching to fit our needs and it's clear that he is very passionate about CS. He also answers a lot of questions during lecture.","319":"yeah he doesnt cover exactly whats on the lecture quizzes but he teaches so well that you can learn the underlying concepts and apply them more generally. ive probably learned more from this class than any other cs class i've taken. if you want a curriculum thats a bit closer to what's actually tested, though, cliff would be a better choice","320":"His written material could be better, but overall I'm a fan.","321":"I straight up thought this class was an embarrassment to UMD (a top 10 CS school) and Agrawala and his TA Andrew were 100% to blame for it. I strongly advise to wait a semester or two and take this with a different professor.\n\r\nI'm not writing this post as sour grapes either I performed pretty well in the class, I just started the semester really excited about learning about networks and in the end it all got sucked out of me.\n\r\nThe worst part of the class, the professor, and the TAs is that they create an environment where it feels like they genuinely want you to fail. If you ask about what content will be on exams (you will have no idea what will be covered) the only answer you will get is \"read the chapter and do the problems.\" FYI chapters are 1-200 pages of thick, technical textbook with 40+ questions each and exams cover 2-3 chapters. \n\r\nI get that college is a lot about being able to teach yourself material, but you shouldn't have to teach yourself an entire class, especially a class as complex as Networks. \n\r\nProjects:\r\n- the first two projects were completely useless busy work that consisted of making simple client-server model. At no point in the class do they help you or show you how you would create such a connection (they just go over it on a high level, much different to actual C function calls), you literally just have to figure it out yourself. Not to mention, you have to use CORE, which is a nightmare within itself that even after the class I still have no idea how to use it. The second project is more about \"can you parse in C\" than it is about networks... Idk about you, but I didn't take 417 so I could waste my time tediously using strtok()\r\n- The final project is actually pretty cool - you implement some real deal stuff and you will learn a lot as a result. I wish they had you do practical things in Ruby all along as opposed to just at the end. Also a bonus that you get to work with a partner\n\r\nAll in all, you WILL learn a lot if you take this class, only because you literally have to memorize a textbook to pass. I did not come to college and pay tuition money to memorize a textbook, however. Professors should make it easier, not harder, to understand material and they should genuinely care about your success - Agrawala is neither.\n\r\nAgain, I did well in this class and I am not writing this because I am sour - i genuinely want you to either not take this class with Agrawala for your own good. If you do, I just hope he has magically improved and changed since.  All things considered, there is no doubt Agrawala is brilliant, he's just not approachable and not a good teacher. Twice I went to office hours with course content questions and for advice and twice I got the answer \"read the textbook\"... not very helpful. \n\r\nCraziest thing is, if Agrawala changed a few things the course wouldn't be so miserable for everyone.\n\r\n1. Provide some kind of study guides for the tests so we know of the hundreds of protocols what to focus on\r\n2. Provide suggested book questions for each chapter so we don't waste our time doing 40+ problems. There is no reason why he can't give 10 questions per chapter or something like that. \"if it's not on the slides don't worry about it\" doesn't help at all\r\n3. Hold some kind of seminar at the beginning of the semester outside of class that introduces students to CORE and how to get set up properly\r\n4. Stretch the last project to be semester long and have students complete it in useful increments (maybe even add a bit to it)\r\n5. Act genuinely interested in the success and well being of the students as opposed to creating an environment where we feel like Agrawala wants us to fail","322":"I think the professor was actually a good teacher. He asked questions to get us to think and to understand why things were the way they are. I will say that the lectures were sort of dry, especially if you read the book. But the point was to get us to learn the basic concepts, and then we would study the details ourselves.\n\r\nI'll admit that the projects weren't entirely connected with the material in the lecture. But to say they were entirely irrelevant is false. I think the previous poster didn't really understand the point of the projects (considering they stated how it was just locate the standard library function and do it in this way, because that wasn't the point). It was to help us to understand how protocols work, and in that sense, it was connected to the material in lecture. But the final project was the most important. It really showed how hard network programming is, because you have to account for so many things, so it's much harder than say, Operating Systems. The final project was meant to help us understand that every decision in networking has some sort of reason behind it. And it does have real world use. So that gives me the sense of accomplishment. It was meant to simulate a real-life project as well, as it took a lot of coding and testing, and you had to work with your group members. I had a group member who only wrote ~200 lines of code or so, but the reason I didn't say anything was because the fact is that we do have other classes, despite this being like a real-life job.\n\r\nI will agree that the lack of study material or review for exams was disappointing, but there is a reason for that. It's hard to make questions that students can solve in a reasonable amount of time that adequately test student knowledge, thus questions are reused. I'd just recommend studying the questions at the back of the book. It is a vast amount of information to cover, but that's how a lot of courses are.\n\r\nOne thing I do agree is that it would've been better to add a reading schedule. It would have helped a lot.\n\r\nOverall, I would say I learned a lot from this course. I learned that understanding networking means understanding communication in general. I learned that there is a reason for every decision in a RFC. The professor also taught us that what we needed to learn is how to learn, because this information will soon be obsolete, and that's something important for CS majors in general.","323":"Agrawala was a horrible professor, and 417 was a horrible class.\n\r\nThis was possibly the worst computer science course I've taken yet at this university.\n\r\nUnlike most other 400-level CS classes, that teach relevant and useful technology, this course seems to be mostly based on obsolete material. The projects don't convey any meaningful skills, and while in other classes I typically can look back on the projects and feel a sense of accomplishment, in this class, I felt like I jumped through hoops. (I got 100% or 90% on all the projects, so this isn't sour grapes -- the projects were just bad.\n\r\nFurther, the projects and lectures seemed entirely disconnected. I felt as if I was taking two different classes where two entirely different things were being taught. Lectures didn't prepare us for projects in any sense. As such, the projects weren't challenging, because they had to be easy enough for us to teach ourselves how to do. This meant that the projects consisted entirely of \"locate the standard library function to do this thing, and invoke it in the right way.\"\n\r\nThe lectures were almost entirely taken from the textbook. If any reading had been assigned, this would mean that people who did the reading would get nothing out of lectures. The lectures were presented in an extremely dry and boring way. The lecturer would occasionally ask either extremely simple factual questions or incredibly complicated questions. Nobody was willing to venture an answer, because there was obviously a right answer (which the students didn't want to get wrong in front of the class), and in the simple case it seemed like the instructor was asking a trick question, while in the complicated case the students weren't sure of themselves. The instructor would, after doing this, chide the class for not participating. Further, the instructor would never revisit old or important material.\n\r\nThe exams were entirely disjoint from the lecture or projects. The two midterms focused almost entirely on concepts that appeared on one or two days of lecture. Further, the instructors refused to give students any information about what would be on the exam. This forced students to study huge amounts of information, including large parts of the textbook (which was tested on the exam, even though no readings had actually been assigned and there was no reading schedule for the course). Most students probably gave up; those that didn't were equally unprepared, because the exams were, rather than general, incredibly specific. The only way to get a good grade on the exam would have been to study in huge detail every aspect of the course. Typically, courses that require this have clear focus and direction, but this course had neither. It was like taking a survey of 1990's networking concepts and technology.\n\r\nOverall, taking this class was a vastly unpleasant experience. I had hoped that something as basic and vital to a computer scientists skillset as *networking* would be treated better at a major university. ","324":"Good professor. Difficult to understand at times because of the accent. He asks a lot of rhetorical questions and goes on and on during lectures; therefore, they seem boring. Also, he just lectures from the slides and he posts his lecture videos and slides online, discouraging many from attending class. By the third week only a handful of people still went (I definitely did not attend), but this could be partly attributed to the class starting at 8am. His exams are almost entirely based on questions from the end of the chapters, and the remaining few questions are based on general terminology\/ definitions of bolded words throughout the chapter. The projects in this class were very fair and interesting in comparison to previous year projects. The class is a lot of work because it feels like a programming class in addition to a theory of networking class (it is known as the 2nd hardest CMSC class). If you can keep yourself motivated and attend most lectures this is a very manageable class. Agrawala is a decent professor, but I feel he could be more interactive and give more examples\/ real life problems. I would recommend him as a professor","325":"Bobby is a very good professor. He is also one of the smartest people at UMD. He's very intimidating at first but if you get to know him you'll realize he's a really nice guy. I think he did a good job teaching this class; needless to say, this was a very challenging course (more so than 412 in my opinion). \n\r\nThis class is conceptually simple, but the devil truly is in the details. Understanding how packets are routed through the internet is not a trivial matter. This requires understanding link-layer switching, and network-layer routing. I think Bobby did a rather crappy job explaining the link-layer. In particular, he failed to articulate the difference between forwarding and routing (which is HUGE). This certainly led to a lot of confusion.\n\r\nEither way, take this course with either Bobby or Neil Spring. Enough said.\n","326":"The review from 2013 is really not telling at all. I had to drop this class because the median of the first test was like a 50. I have a pretty decent GPA (3.6), but this teacher's workload is IMPOSSIBLE to manage unless you purposely make your other courses really light.\r\n\r\nI had to drop and take the W for the sake of my other classes. Don't believe me? There are currently 15\/40 spots open in the class after people dropping, and his average is about a 2.6 based off past years. Basically only take this class if you consider yourself extremely smart, and every other class has been easy for you.","327":"His lectures are mediocre, but the real problem is how he tests code.  He puts our arbitrary project specs without public\/release tests and then tests them in a very specific way, causing many students to get zeros for things such as putting a space in the wrong place in the output. He said he would fix this, but I still have no idea what grade I have in this class.","328":"Honestly, one of the most unorganized classes I've ever taken. Avoid this professor at all costs.\r\n\r\nThe first project took nearly 2 months to get back to us, and over half of the students got zeroes due to shoddy testing code. Every assignment we've had so far has had to be regraded.\r\n\r\nThis morning, the day AFTER the drop deadline, he announces the next midterm and final exam will be in class rather than take-home. Completely unprofessional. ","329":"Such a terrible teacher for 417. Exams and projects are so vaguely worded. You need to make several assumptions on exam questions, but if your implementation doesn't match his you get a 0. When we asked for clarifications, he would sometimes give us misleading answers. He never gave us sample input\/output even though we asked before every project and exam. Half way through the semester he just gave up on doing slides. Grading felt like it was arbitrary, but he told us not to worry about it because he promised a substantial curve. He ended up setting 39 as the cutoff for a C-, but an 85 was still a B, so he might as well have not curved. He also gives out minuses but not pluses.","330":"Marsh for 417 was great. He took a systems approach to the whole class which I really liked. If you didn't like 216 then you'll have a rough time, but projects are easy as long as you can read manpages and use Wireshark. It's impossible to fail his class if you submit even a half-assed attempt on all the projects. All exams including the final were take-home. If you don't get an A in the class it's on you","331":"Overall Professor Marsh was a much better professor than I think most of these reviews suggest. He has made changes based on what I hear on here. He no longer does take home exams which seemed to have been a major issue in past semesters based on past reviews and reddit threads. He is well prepared for lectures, and genuinely seems to care about students' success. He offers a survey active all semester for students to voice their opinions of the course, and he even sent individual messages to the students who did really well on each exam congratulating them on their success which was a nice way to show he actually cares about students doing well, which is really rare among professors here in my opinion. His grading scripts can be frustrating and his lack of public tests is something that I think could be improved, but overall he is not a bad professor. Class is pretty hard, but you learn a lot about how the internet works which is pretty cool.","332":"Based on past reviews, I was extremely weary to take Marsh for this class, but after going through it I\u2019m glad I did. He has improved a ton and takes constructive criticism in stride to actually improve the class (the only cs prof I\u2019ve seen do this). Many complain his test scripts are still broken, but these were due to tests that are more in depth than other courses, which I believe is a great thing. You can also tell he loves the subject. His lectures can be a little tough to follow at times as his examples aren\u2019t always the clearest, but he is willing to reexplain anything that may have been ambiguous. Overall, the most useful class I\u2019ve taken at UMD and no regrets on Marsh. ","333":"Really knows the course material, and much more. Course was unnaturally hard compared to other CMSC courses I've taken. Really tough.","334":"Alright prof, but heavy Indian accent and mumbles sometimes so lectures aren't the easiest to listen to and moves through slides too fast without posting them, but not the worst.","335":"I tried sitting in the back and boy I could not understand a word he said. Don't get me wrong he definitely tries to help but his accent gets in the way. Ended up having to withdraw (the only class I ever withdrew from in 4 years here) as the programming assignments were impossible to complete and were basically irrelevant to the stuff learned in class. The exams required you to memorize pretty much every single calculation and definition and write them out. It was also unclear what exactly you were supposed to know before an exam. Am I supposed to read and learn from the textbook, or from the slides, etc? \r\n\r\nIdk if it was just Roy or if this class would still be so poorly structured even with a different teacher. But for the sake of your GPA just forget about 417 and choose a different class. You'll thank me later.","336":"I don't know why there are some reviews commending Marsh for how he handled this course. I took this course with three friends and all of our experiences were pretty terrible. I would keep in mind that we took this during an online\/Covid semester so in person may be different.\r\n\r\nThe work load for this course is MUCH greater than 3 credits. I spent more time for this course than for most of the core 4 credit CS classes. A typical week would include about an hour of pre-recorded lectures, 2 quizzes on that content, 2 normal lecture hours, then either a MASSIVE project due over the weekend or several homework assignments. There were also 5 exams throughout the semester. Marsh said at the beginning that this courses bad wrap is due to it being \"one of the hardest the department offers\". I don't think the difficulty is the content, its entirely with how the course is organized. The lectures do not coincide with the projects, so for more than half the projects you'll be looking at text books learning the material to execute the projects. Marsh will release public test scripts to test your projects but they typically don't work, causing everyone stress by having to submit their project blindly. His testing scripts would also typically screw up on the projects causing many students to request regrades, which they wouldn't receive back for months later. In 2 instances, information in the project description was either wrong or misleading, which caused due dates to get pushed back. This would be fine except Marsh did not compensate the rest of the schedule. This caused the biggest project of the semester to be given a week less to complete. On the last day of classes, we had an exam, a homework and the big project due. The only reason I did not give this 1 star is that I believe some of the projects are pretty cool once theyre in a complete state. I would not recommend this course unless you genuinely think putting on your resume that you took a formal networking course will help you. If you're just interested in networks, you're better off just looking at networking textbooks and resources online in your freetime.","337":"Please do yourself a favor and take any other professor for this course if you can. Don't get me wrong, he's an incredibly smart professor, but he is just incredibly mean and his courseload is suffocating.","338":"If I could rate 0 stars, I would.\r\n\r\nHe's definitely an entertaining and exceptionally intelligent professor, he'd be cool to have lunch with, TA for or do research under - but all that aside, he is a TERRIBLE instructor and should be avoided at all costs.\r\n\r\nThroughout the semester he has been very passive aggressive & sometimes just flat out mean with his responses to other students in class, on Piazza, and answering student questions on zoom, claiming that his goal is for us to \"learn\", and yet he refuses to straight up give an answer to a homework\/exam question a student asks without making the student look like an idiot for not knowing first. \r\n\r\nAn example of his unpleasant demeanor: on the first day of class he literally said \"I do not expect you to come to class\" yet time and time again he expresses passive aggressive frustration with those who do not attend class or office hours.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, for some reason he REFUSES to upload recordings of lectures, nor any coherent powerpoint slides (instead he uploads drawings and scribbles he does during lecture that only someone who went to lecture would really understand) - either forcing students to join the Zoom call live or show up to class to stay on top of the material. This is the first course I have taken at UMD that does not provide at least some form of slides or an outline on the material covered in class. The problem with this practice is that his exams, while open note, are 100% based on content he covers in class so if you miss class and office hours & do not take detailed notes in class you're basically screwed.\r\n\r\nWhile all my other professors have been uploading recordings of their lectures, Bobby refuses. He will likely claim that because people joining on Zoom do not give their express consent to be recorded he won't do it or something to that effect, but if he actually cared he would use Panopto or some other solution.\r\n\r\nComing back to in person after 3 semesters of remote learning is tough, and since I am still used to asynchronous learning it has been a particular struggle for me to stay on top of projects and study for exams in this course.\r\n\r\nTLDR: Bobby's attitude and expectations for the course leave a lot to be desired, and his teaching skills are not that of a professor who should be making a $200,000\/year+ salary (which is likely due to his research and tenure at the university but still). He should stick to research or graduate level courses but for the good of future CS undergraduate students, he should NOT BE TEACHING UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL COURSES.","339":"Taking 417 with Bobby is the Dark Souls of CMSC\r\n\r\nYou know what you're getting into if you take this course\r\n\r\nBobby is a great lecturer, the only thing I think he could improve on is recording his lectures so that you can go back to watch them later.\r\n\r\nThe programming projects are intense and will consume all your time. I agree with Bobby's methodologies for choosing C over other languages for the projects. I wish that we had fewer projects and more time to work on them, as they would often be a matter of \"write until time is over\" instead of \"write until your project is working\/complete\". I think I would have learned more if I had the time to actually focus on getting some of the implementations working instead of having to move onto the next project.","340":"Was my favorite class at UMD, really learned a lot about not just Networks, but about low level programming in general. \r\n\r\nThat said, other reviews about Bobby is fair. He's been in the field so long (he once told us in class that he's seen networks composed of single copper wire that people poke in needles to connect to, which is at least before 1985) that he kind of lost touch with what students already know\/not know. \r\n\r\nI enjoyed the lectures (he's a pretty funny person). I learned a lot from projects too, despite it being very time consuming and often very underspecified. (There are no public tests to test the output formats against)\r\n\r\nI do really recommend this class with Bobby, but only if you you have some previous knowledge in computer networking and\/or have strong C\/C++ programming skills. ","341":"I took this course Spring 2021.\r\nCMSC417 is definitely not trivial and the projects take time, but I also enjoyed it and learned a huge amount. Marsh uses flipped classroom but the lecture videos he posts are broken into short sections and are very clear. The projects and homeworks help you learn the material well and the tests were open-note on Gradescope.","342":"Although I have a W, I have decided to audit this class and do the projects at my own pace. I was struggling with finding a job and made the mistake of taking another extremely programming-heavy course and I wasn't confident enough in C to finish the projects without error. I hope whoever reads these reviews knows that the 5-star reviews are not given by \"normal\" people. They're either really good at C, very passionate about networking, or just don't care about red flags. These are people who are not bothered by Bobby's demeanor or attitude and fail to realize that although they had a good experience, there are many people in the class who don't. \r\n\r\nI want to give a rather detailed review. I think Bobby's teaching philosophy can be somewhat debatable, so I'll mention what can be done better: [-]: negative or can be improved upon. [?] Depends on your perspective. [+] Undisputable good quality\r\n\r\n[-] Not recording lectures or office hours: I think the whole idea behind this is that when people know a lecture is being recorded, they stop attending class. Although this is true, we have to see if this is a good thing or a bad thing for the students. It might be demoralizing for the professor since he might not be able to interact with a class and you could argue this is bad for the students since some students are lazy and fall behind schedule because \"everything is recorded\". So let's analyze this in detail: [+] Bobby provides OH \"relectures\" for people who missed the class. [-] Bobby does not record OH even if people have other classes during the time of OH and sometimes refuses to discuss what was mentioned in detail because he \"discussed it many times in OH\". [-] Some students like me usually will rewatch lectures to fill in missing gaps in our knowledge, not having lectures recorded means we have to go on Piazza but given the next bullet points this isn't so \"smooth\". Overall, I think if Bobby wants people to attend lectures, he should find a way to take attendance and leverage it in part with the participation grade. \r\n\r\n[-] Being demeaning to the students: This is an area Bobby needs to work on for sure. You can't go out there and call people stupid or get annoyed when people can't grasp concepts easily. I've seen instances where he literally said \"this is a stupid question\" even when the question was somewhat relevant. Maybe this might be why he doesn't record.......\r\n\r\n[?] Not giving previous exam solutions:  This is probably a blessing in disguise. You are forced to learn where and how to find the information you need instead of having them given to you and just learning through pattern matching. I think this is a good thing but you can easily argue this is a bad thing.\r\n\r\n[?] Projects take up too much time: The tradeoff is that the projects are cool and useful on your CV. If you take this class, you should be informed that it is hard and a lot of work. Don't make the mistake of taking this with other hard classes.\r\n\r\n[+] Great Lecturer: Bobby can explain concepts well and you get engaged rather easily\r\n\r\nOverall, Bobby is your stereotypical grandiose narcissist who has a valid reason to be narcissistic. I rate him 3 stars because I feel like Bobby is an amazing lecturer but the 2 [-] are what makes him rather unpleasant. I have a feeling that even if he is given similar feedback from other students, he might not listen to them and continue with his current ways.","343":"He admittedly does not cover the material he is supposed to, and whenever he does, it is always a very cursory overview whereas Fawdi Emad's section comprehensively went over all of the material, yet we were all given the same exams and quizzes, all written by Fawzi. Seems pretty unfair, eh? \r\nOn the bright end, Yiannis is a very nice person who appreciates other people's input. He may not be the best professor, but thankfully this class is extremely easy to begin with and you can be fine by just teaching yourself everything from the textbook.","344":"He is the most accommodating person I've ever met. If you have a problem and you address it to him, he will absolutely help you out. He is completely engrossed in the success of his students. This is an extremely rare quality in a professor.\n\r\nThere are only a few things holding me back from giving him five stars. Firstly, he goes on a lot of tangents. If you are the type of student who learns solely from lectures, it might be difficult since sometimes he does not cover all of the material. Secondly, he seems to have difficulty teaching the students who have difficulty grasping the concepts. If you really have trouble with theoretical math and logic, it might be best to take it with a different professor.","345":"Dr. Aloimonos is a great guy, good teacher, and interesting to listen to in lecture. Like some of the other reviews said, he covers the material really quickly and perhaps not in as much detail as they should be, but if you do the worksheets in discussion and\/or study, you'll be fine. His lectures are good to go to because he covers a lot of stuff that other professors don't, and talks about philosophy and stuff sometimes (its always somewhat relevant though). \n\r\nHe knows a lot, but if you don't want to study and don't already know some of the material, then maybe someone else would be better.","346":"He is a great professor and a teacher. I mean he may not cover the subject material in any detail (u HAVE to read book to get stuff and practice for this class). But it is a fun class with him coz' he brings in so many higher level fun topics into the discussion. he is very knowledgeable and funny. recommended if u like logic math.","347":"Best professor in the Computer Science Department, and I don't think it can even be debated. I've taken him with both 131 and 250. \n\r\nFawzi teaches every course with a genuine interest and enthusiasm that just makes you want to learn and grasp every concept. His ability to teach with clarity is absolutely amazing. In addition, he's always there to help if you have any difficulties with the material. \n\r\nHis quizzes, homeworks, and exams are incredibly fair and with a good amount of studying, doing well in the class shouldn't be an issue. CMSC250 is traditionally known as one of the weedout courses, but with Fawzi it never seemed like one.\n\r\nIf you ever get a chance to decide between Fawzi and another professor, you pick Fawzi, end of discussion. ","348":"Fawzi is the best teacher I have had at UMD, if not the best teacher I've ever had. He knows the material very well, is actively interested in it, and loves to spark interest in others.\r\nHis tests are not necessarily easy, but they are a very fair reflection of the course.\r\nThe best part about Fawzi, though, is that he's just a really cool guy. He has a great balance of nerdy, intellectual habits and a perfectly normal personality. He's the type of person you'd want to have as an uncle. ","349":"Fawzi was a really fun and engaging professor for 250. Although the material in the class is fairly difficult, he manages to make the material fun and engaging sometimes. He's actually funny, which is another plus since his jokes will probably wake up the class if they ever decided to doze off. Tests were pretty fair too, sticking to questions that were on quizzes. The homework assignments were challenging, but at the same time doable. Overall a great class for me, and I definitely would take Fawzi again if I could.","350":"Fawzi was a great teacher. Fawzi sets his expectations at a reasonable level and then expects you to meet them, unlike many teachers that expect WAY too much and then curve. Curves always seem to add more stress to the class than necessary.\n\r\nFawzi always did a good job conveying his thoughts, and was also good at coming up with multiple ways to explain the same concept for people who were struggling.\n\r\nFair exams too. Don't expect much of a curve, but you shouldn't need it since he's fair.","351":"This class was one of the more boring\/frustrating ones that I have taken here at UMD.  It seemed like the curriculum we covered was just all over the place, and I didnt feel like I learned much at all from this class.  The graduate teaching assistants for this class were not good at all; they didnt care very much about the students and were horrible at grading exams.  A lot of people found 5-10 points worth of mistakes on each of the exams, in addition to the fact that many of the points awarded were subject to the grader's own opinion, rather than actually getting a right\/wrong answer.  \r\nAs for Dr. Hugue, most of the stuff mentioned below is true.  She is pretty crazy, which can make the class funny at times but will also annoy you to no end if you actually are confused about something and want to learn the material.  In lecture it seemed as though she just went over random topics with no real sense of organization or purpose.  I had to teach myself everything for the assignments and exams.  She is a really nice person who will listen to you after class and respond promptly to email.  If I had to choose over again Id take this class with Perlis, because I learned more from him the one time I was in his lecture than I did all year in Dr. Hugue's lecture.","352":"Hugue...oh boy. I thought the subject matter of 250 was pretty boring to begin with, and Hugue didn't change my mind. Lectures start off with a TA teaching for the first few minutes, then Hugue going over slides mixed in with random stories about her life. \n\r\nHomework is easy, about 20 minutes a week, and quizzes are just as easy, as long as you've done the homework and stayed semi-conscious in lecture.\n\r\nTests are okay, alot of partial credit, which is great if you mess up on a proof.\n\r\nHugue isn't great but compared to the other professors I'd prefer her. From what I hear the other 250 professors are like Hugue minus the stories in lecture, and that's the only thing keeping me from falling into comas during lecture. Also, she's much nicer than the other professors. She wants the class to do well and promises to curve\/give partial credit\/etc. if it will help the class.","353":"","354":"I second that the guy is anal. You should avoid him as much as possible ...trust me , start planning your schedule from avoiding any of his classes ... You will regret the day you decided \"Oh, well, this class fit into my schedule\"","355":"He was pretty good at teaching the material. However, appraoching him outside of class is out of the question. He just does not seem to want to help people, and even gets angry when you send him emails asking about the homework. Tests and quizzes were pretty fair though.","356":"Herman is not a bad teacher; you will likely understand some material from lectures and take some solid knowledge away from the class. His tests were also quite fair in this class.\n\r\nHe is, however, completely unapproachable before class, many times shrugs people off during office hours. He wouldn't even let me ask him if I could come to an earlier lecture session, because he was \"too busy.\"\n\r\nHe is also VERY partial to girls, often fawning and flirting.","357":"His lectures are good but he's very self-absorbed, biased and will passive aggressively undermine students he doesn't like. He wastes lecture time on repeatedly describing his past exploits catching proofing errors in other people's work, but then leaves core topics for TAs to teach in discussion.  \n\r\nToo few exercises & worked problems overall. Pedantic, with heavy focus on empty formalism.  He starves his course without adequate worked problems, especially since he places so much emphasis on extremely formal procedural steps.  You often can't tell if you got points off because of some formal expression nicety you didn't follow or because your whole proof was wrong.  It's difficult to learn well when you have only a couple of examples for each core topic to work off.  If he didn't leave so much core teaching to his TAs, the discussion sections could be used for more exemplars and working of problems, but as it is there is inadequate work.\n\r\nHe compensates for this all by having limited coverage of topics and never gets to graphs at all.  All he really cares about (obsesses over) is formulaic formalism, it seems.\n\r\nYet, he hands out a lot of A's simply because students who want to memorize off the few worked examples you get and the limited coverage his course provides can do well in his classes.  The people who have it worst are those who want to do their own work (not get solutions from other people) and not memorize problem-solving.\n\r\nThe average students who do well in his class are ones who band together and pool their resources to create a set of solved problems.  What they are doing in effect is compensating for how he starves his course for worked problems and exercises.\n\r\nHis personal biases and prejudices against individual students comes across strongly at times in the classroom, like when he snaps impatiently at a student he clearly thinks is a fool.  Personality and appearance-wise, he's rather like that character in the Simpsons who runs the comic book store.","358":"I know this is late but I had her for 250 over the summer. I was a little scared because I've heard crazy mixed reviews, but there is nothing to be afraid of. She is very kind and helpful but most importantly she wants her students to succeed. She knows that the material can be confusing so she goes over it and makes sure the class understands before moving onto the next unit. \n\r\nWhat I really love about her is how approachable she is. She had set office hours but I sometimes showed up at her office randomly and she still was happy to help. \n\r\nShe is really helpful about exam grading too. She will explain to you why you got the grade you did and will negotiate with you if you don't think you deserved it. There was one time I misread a question and would have lost a lot of points but I explained that to her and she let me rewrite my answer.\n\r\nShe is overall a very understanding and caring professor. She made 250 a fun class (like we were doing puzzles rather than long boring proofs). I recommend her not only as a professor but also an adviser (you can ask her about anything!)  ","359":"Lecture:\r\nKruskal seemed to be a little out of his element this semester (Spring 2012). He supposedly never uses power point, but was forced to because Meesh said her class and his class had to keep up with each other. I didn't really learn much from the power point slides, most of the interesting tricks came when Kruskal would steer away and do one of his 'fun' problems. \r\nHe was disorganized and late to every class. I honestly don't know how I learned during lecture, but I did. So I would suggest going to lecture (no pop quizzes or anything like that though). \n\r\nHomework:\r\nAssigned weekly, and very hard. I took MATH310 and MATH406 (A+ in both) already, and I thought this homework was very difficult. \n\r\nQuizzes:\r\nOn Monday's during discussion. Usually pretty easy, just look over the slides.\n\r\nExams:\r\nthe midterms were long, I kind of finished them, but I didn't really get to check my answers.\n\r\nFinal:\r\nHe randomly gave us 2 hours and 7 minutes to finish the final. When I asked him why he just said \"I have my reasons\" which is the response he gives to just about everything...\r\nThe exam itself was not that bad, I got a 90% but the class average was a 60%. It was only a little bit longer than the midterms, but it was harder. \n\r\n**Finally I would like to say that I considered testing out of this class, since I was a math major I could have probably passed the placement exam. But I wanted the free 4 credit A. Turns out this class is not a free 4 credit A no matter how much math you know. Kruskal makes the homeworks too hard for that. That being said I think that you should take this class rather than test out of it, I learned a lot of stuff (especially Induction stuff, which isn't covered very well by the math dept. but Kruskal did a extensive covering of induction).\n\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nI also had Kruskal for 351:\n\r\nHe did a much better job in 351 than he did in 250. I think he just wasn't really into the 250 stuff. In 351 his exams and HW were very hard, but he curves like crazy so don't worry about it (like a 60% = B for our class). This seems weird, but it is done because it is hard to test algorithms. \n\r\nThe only thing I didn't like was that there was one midterm that was 40% of my grade, the final was 50% and homeworks were 1% each.\n\r\nOn exams if you are asked to make-up an algorithm on the spot just make one that works and disregard efficiency, you get a lot of points for one that works. Efficiency will get you more points, but just move onto the next question and try for efficiency if you have more time at the end of the exam.","360":"You have to work your butt off in this class because it is a hard class to begin with. But, to top it off, the professor doesn't teach well. Hopefully you have a good TA","361":"Heh, what can I say about Kruskal... first off, I had him for both CMSC250 and CMSC351. He seems very averse to doing work, and though he is very smart he rarely imparts this knowledge on students in a way that really impresses people. His lectures can be disjointed (he never has slides) and it can be hard to follow what he is doing, most of the class was not able to learn the material from the lectures.\n\r\nOn the other hand, if he likes the material, I feel like he is able to teach something. And he seems to be really passionate about algorithms. So there is a silver lining - if you understand and follow what he does, you can learn.","362":"Honestly, going to class is optional and so is reading the book. However, I hear the book is excellent in clearing up most of the topics covered. Also, find someone that has taken the class before because at some point they find out the textbook is available online...\r\nHis exams are based on the homeworks and almost identical to the practice exams he puts online.\r\nI can't comment much on his teaching style because I never paid attention in class. But he posts notes up online if you need, I never used them. I never studied for this class. Understand the homeworks and you'll do well. I loved Perlis because the way he grades helps out everyone and does it in such a way that is beneficial for everyone. He has no need to curve but he might. I definitely recommend him. I will say that some of his classes are extremely boring and I learned nothing from them.   ","363":"Easy class. Weekly quizzes and homeworks given, but mostly re-iterate simple topics. Grading in the class is set up to help immensely.\n\r\nHonestly, the material is not too difficult, so there isn't really much to say. Perlis' lectures are okay, but attending them is not actually necessary to understand the topics.","364":"Perlis is a great professor to take CMSC250 with. Coming into this semester, I read ourumd.com's reviews and I was pessimistic about this course because of the low reviews and comparatively low GPA that Perlis had, but after taking this class I can assure you that Perlis is fair, if not even easy to take.\n\r\nHis tests are fairly easy with a major recurring focus on induction, and his homeworks are pretty fair as long as you pay attention to details. The quizzes are extremely easy and are just attendance points. The curve is significant and he dropped the lowest 2 homeworks and 2 quizzes. Combined with the curve, this allows you to pretty much have an 85% and get an A. I'd definitely take 351 or whatever other classes he teaches in the future, because I enjoyed this class, learning about new mathematical concepts, and getting the A at the end.","365":"Perlis is a pretty good professor. He is extremely fair on every assignment, quiz, and exam in terms of what he asks and how he has the TA's grade it. He tries very hard to make the material interesting with his own little twists in how he presents the topics.\n\r\nHowever, the topics were fairly easy in general, especially if you come from a strong math background, so class can seem like a waste of time. Also, he mostly just presents stuff from the book, so you technically don't really need to go to class at all if you can just learn it from the book.\n\r\nThough this class, while being easy, will introduce you to some very interesting areas of math which I'm assuming will be covered in more detail in later classes. \n\r\nOverall, you've got a few very interesting topics, a pretty good professor who is at least very fair in grading, and not much hw (just one short assignment due each week), making this a decent class to take.","366":"Coming from MATH, I can say 250 is an unique course.  It takes elements from different math categories that you have either seen (As a math major) or will see (as a CS major).  Some overlaps include elementary number theory (seen it if you took MATH406), counting (seen it if you took STAT400), and logical equivalences (CE majors probably have already seen truth tables and logical curcuits.  Although, I was very familiar this class is not a walk in the park.  Hence the overall GPA of the course.\n\r\nIf you want to get a 4-credit A or B, take this class with no one other than Perlis.  He has two methods:\r\nMethod one:  15% quizzes, 15% homework, 20% midterm 1, 20% midterm 2, 30% final\r\nMethod two:  15% quizzes, 15% homework, 30% best of two midterms, 40% final\n\r\nYour grade is determined based on the highest of the two methods and the curve.  This class with Perlis is really convenient, especially if you are taking 212 or 313.  I suggest taking this with Perlis if you are taking them, or take 250 and 212 or 313 separately.","367":"This professor consistently confuses himself to the point where he wants to bang his own head on the wall and waste 25 minutes of our 80 minutes lecture time.\r\nHis examples in class are completely irrelevant to the stuff on the quizzes and the final.\n\r\nThe homeworks are challenging but if you memorize the examples solved in the book you will do fine.\n\r\nFinal verdict: Because Perlis is incompetent at understanding the material himself, he is not the best professor to take this course with. It's like paying good tuition for someone who doesn't even know what he's talking about. Pick another professor.","368":"Perlis is an interesting guy, very frail. His lectures aren't difficult to follow, and his tests are ridiculously easy. I went to about 50% of lectures up until the first exam and got a 100 on it. I then did not attend one lecture for the rest of the semester, and still got a B+ on the final (left a lot blank, and did not review or study at all) and an A in the course. Sometimes he seems to get a little confused in class, but always answers any questions via email (which gets really annoying after a while, since he replies to the whole class).\n\r\nMy recommendation is to attend all of the discussion sections, as this is where you will see what you really need to know.","369":"Personally, I agree with some of the earlier complaints about Perlis confusing himself on some of his examples and problems, but he always corrects himself when he figures it out, by email if he can't in person.  He also sends answers to any homework questions students ask him to the entire class listserv, which can be very helpful in figuring out the problems.  The homeworks are hard, but considering that you have a week to do them and can ask questions about the assignments to the TAs (I personally had Peter Fontana, who I have to say made everything SO much easier) or Perlis in class or via email, they're not so bad.  Quizzes are also hard, sometimes extremely so, but to compensate, he drops two of them at the end of the semester.  He also drops two homeworks.\n\r\nAs for exams, as long as you have a reasonable understanding of the material, they're quite easy.  None of them are terribly long; a few large questions, a few short answers, a couple fill-in-the-blanks, and you're done.  To make things even better, if you screw up terribly on one of the midterms, it gets dropped (though the other midterm and the final are made to count for more to compensate).\n\r\nAll told, I found Perlis to be a very fair and nice teacher, which is a lot more than I can say for some others.","370":"Dr. Perlis would post huge reviews online that were normally problems taken right out of the book and then changed a tiny bit... with a couple tricks.\n\r\nThe range of grades in the class is very large. As any math major that is in the class will maintain an easy A, while pure CS students will struggle.\n\r\nThe curve for our class was as follows:\r\nFor each student grades were calculated as follows:\r\nMethod 1: HWK 15%; QUIZZES 15%; TWO MIDTERMS 20% each; FINAL 30% \r\nMethod 2: HWK 15%; QUIZZES 15%; MIDTERM (best of two) 30%; FINAL 40% \n\r\nThe curve is as follows:\r\nA  >= 85.6\r\nB  >= 76.0\r\nC  >= 58.5\r\nD  >= 47.7\n\n","371":"this guy is the worst lecturer ever. he is all over the place, and has terrible handwriting. he insists on using markers that are half out on the dry erase board. you can tell that he knows what he is doing somewhere in his crazy little head, but he just cannot translate it into something other people will understand. the course itself is also rather dumb. most of it is spent formally proving intuitive things. ex. on the final, he gave a hint that 1+1=2.... okay this is all good and fun, but when it is graded off because you stopped your proof when things got that intuitive, someone needs to get shot. ","372":"THE worst professor ive ever had. unorganized during class, VERY sloppy notes, quizzes are often not relevant to anything gone over in class. his explanations are terrible because he gets confused with his own problems a lot. halfway through a problem he will realize he made a mistake and go back through the entire problem. homeworks are mostly hard. in my opinion he might know what hes doing, hes just terrible at explaining it. also, he'll spend an entire lecture on the same topic doing the same 2 or 3 problems. a lot of the class is based on learning things from the book or online. \n\n\r\nBUT, there is a HUGE curve!!!\r\nA  >= 85.6\r\nB  >= 76.0\r\nC  >= 58.5\r\nD  >= 47.7\n\r\nit saved me from taking the class again!!!","373":"terrible, terrible professor!! is very unorganized, gives examples that make no sense, quizzes cover stuff not covered in lecture","374":"I've never seen a professor baffled by his own sample problem until I took this class. Literally, he would give us a practice problem over the listserv and then be unable to solve it the next day. He was disorganized and invariably gave an inaccurate description of his exam material. For example, his \"cumulative final\" had a small section at the beginning pertaining to early course work and the remainder of the exam was based solely in the material of the last two lectures. The average on that exam was... distressing. ","375":"Knows the material well. Really helpful and nice \u2014 would definitely recommend as a TA to anyone.","376":"Great! So enthusiastic about the material and he carries it over to teaching his students!","377":"Jason is very knowledgeable in this course, it's just that the there's a lot of material and it's difficult ","378":"I had the misfortune of taking Jason for CMSC250 in the Fall 16 semester. It was not a pleasant experience. We had quizzes in discussion every wednesday and it was on material we would review then and there and be tested on it immediately after. Not how I learn. \r\n\r\nHis lecture slides were too...brogrammer like. He made \"post lecture\" quizzes every time after lecture due online 10 minutes before our next lecture. These were pretty stupid and I never did well on any of them. \r\n\r\nThe homeworks were really hard and I could never do them on my own. I found myself in the TA room doing them every week which was really frustrating. \r\n\r\nAs a lecturer he is very dull. Very technical and doesnt explain things very clearly. I had to rely on TA's a lot just to understand the whole point behind proofs and induction. And when it came time for combinatorics, I was eaten alive....\r\n\r\nJason is pretty immature. At the end of my semester, not only did he NOT CURVE but he sent out a message on ELMS where he defended himself for his lousy teaching and blaming it on what he called a \"un sexy bowel decease\". I understand he has become the only option for 250 and he apparently sounds better for 420, but if you have to take him for the former, I suggest you spend a lot of time studying with a group or become buddies with a TA. If you have other options, avoid Jason.","379":"Had him for 250 in Fall 2017 and he was great. Jason's homeworks can definitely be long, but they're straightforward if you pay attention in class or know how to search for information you don't know. Exams were also very fair. His exams always had a free bonus point question on topics unrelated to class as well.\r\n\r\nOverall, I would definitely recommend Jason for 250","380":"Nice guy. Gets a little frazzled during class and always read off the slides. Helpful in office hours but overall very average, not the worst","381":"One of the best TA's I've ever had. Rohan goes out of his way to help the students and I actually learned more from him than from the prof. He sends out useful practice resources before exams. Other than being very knowledgeable about the subject, he actually cared if we learned the material. I couldn't have succeeded in the class without him","382":"If you can take Jason Filippou instead for CMSC250, you should. Kruskal knows the material and can teach it, but he always complains about his lack of interest in CMSC250 and even when he teaches, skips over steps. He thinks that everyone knows about certain things, so he'll just skip over things, but most people attending the lecture may not know what he is doing. However, he does like to joke around and have some fun, so his lectures can be interesting on occasion. Normally, I attend his lectures and then look at Jason's slides on ELMS, which are more in-depth and have better examples. \r\n\r\nIf you have to take Kruskal due to the fit of your schedule, you will be fine, but I hope that he has regained excitement in teaching CMSC250.","383":"I took 250 Fall 2017, my 1st semester of freshman year (no joke here). I thought he was a great teacher. The homework I recall could be difficult at times, but if you did them then you'd be ok. Even though my TA was terrriiibble, I still got an A. So I guess a mix of Jason + working hard. I'm taking 420 now and I have Jason again. It is lit","384":"I couldn't really understand what he was saying in lectures because he goes on so many tangents. I attended Jason Filippou's lectures instead, and quickly understood concepts better. Barely scraped by with a B-, though because 250 was tough for me as I was new to that style of math. Tough class, but interesting and insightful. I learned a lot, but I would recommend taking Filippou instead if given the chance.","385":"Clyde's class is difficult. His homeworks are the same as Eastman's, but different from Jason's. I found that the \"prep\" and the self-study sheets that Jason would post around midterms or throughout the semester were very helpful if you did all the problems listed. Most of the exam problems look just like the ones on the practice midterms but expect a few curveballs.\r\n\r\nAs an instructor, Clyde is objectively frustrating to follow. He'll take examples from the slides and change them so that if you don't pay close attention the whole time, you may end up lost. \r\n\r\nAsking questions in class is good. He won't demoralize you if you have the balls to ask a question, but if you try and answer a question that HE asks, and you get it even slightly wrong, he will not be forgiving. Just before Thanksgiving, he taught a lecture that was like an intro to algorithms, and there were only 15 of us in class that day (weather was bad and it was the day before break). I guessed the answer to one of his problems, and upon learning that I got it wrong, he followed it up with \"I guess you really don't know anything.\" It's objectively a terrible teaching tactic, but the TA's will be a lot more helpful in giving constructive feedback during discussions or office hours.\r\n\r\nMy tips for surviving the Clyde:\r\n\r\n1. I definitely wouldn't have survived without this. Go to discussion. The TA's will go over problems more in-depth than he does and will answer your questions without ridicule. I personally never went to office hours but if that's your thing hey more power to you.\r\n2. Do problems from the textbook to prepare for exams. I got a 78 on the first midterm when I didn't do this, and then a 98 on the second when I cracked open the book.\r\n3. Look back at the homework to get an idea of the types of questions that can come up on exams. Oftentimes, midterm problems will be carbon copies of these with a few words or numbers changed.\r\n4. Follow along during lecture on a laptop with the lecture slides. I found it helpful to get some notes a minute or two in advance of him covering it. Side note - Jason makes the slides and Clyde lectures on it, so that's why it seems like he's only reading it for the first time. Also, Clyde will sometimes skip over a lot of slides at once because he feels it's not important, but it can be helpful to get a couple more examples under your belt while he's rambling.\r\n5. Try to keep your cool. Clyde is so frustrating, I can't stress this enough, but if you're taking his class, the best you can do is get your bearings and learn more in-depth on your own time (which honestly can be during lecture).\r\n\r\nI hated his class, but I'm taking 351 next semester with him because I'm a freshman and register last so wish me luck.","386":"Jason is disorganized and disrespectful. I would not recommend taking him. Also, don't even bother to go to class. He records all his lectures and even so you won't learn anything from them that you couldn't learn from reading the slides.","387":"Jason was a decent teacher and I liked his style of handwriting problems step by step during lecture. However, sometimes he could be unclear about the small details, such as how to write an inductive hypothesis for strong vs weak induction, and the TAs would have to clear that up during discussion. He also could get very defensive or annoyed if people asked a lot of questions during lecture, which was entertaining once in a while.\r\n\r\nThe homework problems could be hard but go to office hours early in the week and some of the TAs were very helpful (I figured out early in the semester that some of the TAs were very confusing and explained things in a super complicated high-level way while other TAs explained the problems clearly so be careful which office hours you go to). A lot of the times Jason would make mistakes on the homework questions and then have to send out an announcement, that happened quite frequently throughout the semester so pay attention to your ELMS announcements. At the end of the semester Jason dropped our lowest homework grade which was a pleasant surprise because it wasn't in the syllabus and he didn't tell us until then he was going to do it.\r\n\r\nThe two midterms were quite fair and very similar to the homeworks, so the best way to study was to go over the homework problems and then if you have more time go over class and discussion problems. I thought the final was much more difficult because a bulk of it was on a topic (countability) that we had learned at the very end of the semester and had only learned very briefly. I did the worst on the final but ended up getting a B in the class because Jason curved a decent amount (6-7%) considering I didn't think he would curve at all. \r\n\r\nIn general for this class I would say keep on top of your studying and every week go over the problems from lecture and discussion. Ask a lot of questions in discussion and office hours (but be careful who you ask your questions to if you want a clear concise answer lol).","388":"Good lecturer. Exams were fair, but you need to study and stay on top of things.","389":"Honestly he's a great TA that clearly cares a lot about his students and their success. He made a review sheet for our exam when the prof didn't provide one, and attending discussion with him definitely boosted my final grade. Very understanding with any issues \/ conflicts students had. ","390":"Terrible terrible teacher. Posts slides online but it is completely useless, any problems in the slides are marked \"do in class\". Teaches on the fly without clear formatting whatsoever. Waste of our time.","391":"The class was very disorganized. There was a lack of slides and it was clear that TAs and professors did not communicate (TAs often did not know what we were learning in lecture), nor did the professors seem to communicate with each other. Some of the homework problems were ridiculously hard but for the most part TAs were fair in grading both homeworks and exams. The midterms were pretty fair and similar to the homeworks except for the occasional challenge question, but the final was much longer and harder than the midterms despite having the same amount of time to finish as the midterms, making it an unfair exam (average was less than 60%). It took a long time to get grades in and the class did not have much structure to it, although I know that this was Sekora's first time teaching 250. Sekora was an engaging lecturer despite my complaints with the way the class was run.","392":"Kruskal made it clear he was not too excited to be teaching 250 this semester. He is a knowledgeable professor but during lecture he would often refuse to answer questions and would sometimes make students feel unintelligent. He was not very responsive to students' concerns and the class was not very well run. If you take him make sure you attend lecture because he purposely does not record lectures and there are often no slides posted (and if they are, all the examples are absent and say \"do in class\").","393":"Taking him for CMSC250 in Summer 2019. He is a good instructor at what he teaches but I will never understand why he insists on making the homework feel like hell. I hate having to rely on going to office hours to understand it. It never makes me feel prepared for any kind of midterm; if anything, it only makes you feel worse.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, he doesn't put in grades into ELMS, which makes it harder to calculate your own grade in the class (something that I don't understand either). This makes always ask questions about what the curve is going to be, and we don't have a generally good feeling about how we will do.\r\n","394":"Easily one of the worst instructors I have ever had. Makes silly mistakes nearly every lecture and uses nonstandard terminology that makes no sense to mathematicians. For a discrete math class, I feel like the topics could have been introduced more rigorously with precise definitions and more formal proofs. This guy once said that \"the rationals are closed under multiplication\" and that \"the derivative of a sequence is undefined, so it is zero everywhere,\" or something along those lines. Instances like these made me question if this guy was even qualified to teach a discrete math class. In fact, they should change the name to \"introductory proof writing for computer scientists,\" or just allow the math department to teach the topics instead (in fact math310 covers more content in greater detail so it is a mystery why it does not exempt students from cmsc250). The quizzes that he has started doing in Fall 2019 are basically joke questions whose only purpose is to force students to attend his lectures. Also, the guy is super passive-aggressive and sends out ELMS announcements pretty much every day. One of the head TAs is extremely cringy, and although I would say he's overqualified for the role, he's super unprofessional and tries way too hard to be likable. Also, homework problems prepared by this TA in question often use ambiguous terminology such as \"simple\" or \"new\" that is never given a precise definition in class.","395":"Perfect!","396":"Fawzi is an amazing proffesor, one of the best in CMSC. He makes topics that could be really hard as easy as possible. Homework always fits well with the exams. Warning that he has a dry sense of humor so if you're not prepared for it you might think he's making fun of you. Hilarious and cares about his students.","397":"Imagine being the reviewer beneath me, and criticizing Jason for making mistakes, but you being the one who made the mistakes.  I could never.","398":"Great","399":"Knows his material. Loved that the homeworks were challenging and collaboration was allowed. Had to put a lot of effort but personally learnt a lot","400":"Class was fun. Very mathematical and rigorous. Actually prepared me pretty well for 351.\r\nHe posts lecture notes, which I feel are more helpful than slides that other instructors use.\r\nHomeworks and exams are hard but he curves generously. If you're looking for an easy time though, avoid him.","401":"This class made me enjoy mathematical reasoning. Perlis is not very strict on notation and is more concerned with the overall mathematical concepts, which is nice. I bought a textbook but never had to use it because his lecture notes are very detailed. His exams are almost entirely based off the homeworks, which makes studying for them easier. He's a nice guy too and gives a lot of info on what to expect on the exams.","402":"Prof. Perlis was a great choice for CMSC250! Take his section if you can.\r\n\r\nThe good:\r\nLecture notes and discussion practice are thorough and updated frequently on ELMS - textbook not even required!\r\nExams were fair in both difficulty and length, with averages around the department norm of 80. \r\nOf the homeworks (~2 per week), one easy (\"A\") and one hard (\"B\") version are dropped, and one midterm as well, if it benefits your final grade.\r\nFeedback is prompt, and Prof. Perlis is always willing to help you understand topics!\r\n\r\nThe bad:\r\nLectures can sometimes be a bit dry or repetitive - staying attentive can be difficult.\r\n\"B\" homeworks are quite a bit more challenging than the exams, and often require you to think outside the box to get full points.\r\n\r\nMy advice: GO TO CLASS. Ask TAs for help in discussion! Start your homeworks (especially \"B\") homeworks early. Also, ignore the older reviews for this class - Prof. Perlis no longer assigns quizzes in discussion.\r\n","403":"Fair professor but can be really unapproachable\/rude with the way he responds to students' piazza posts and elms messages. There are pop worksheets (basically quizzes to make people attend lectures) that are graded on \"participation\" but are actually graded on accuracy. Sometimes he is nice and tells us when to expect a worksheet. He goes over fairly easy examples in class but the homework and worksheets are usually much harder so if you didn't take good notes or rewatched his lecture, you'll be very unlucky for the worksheet. He also curved DOWN the entire semester since people were doing pretty decent in the class but since students didn't too hot on the final, there ended up being a slight curve up.\r\n\r\nMain pro: records lectures and has great TAs\r\nMain con: expects you to know the material completely once it's taught (hence the timed worksheets the following lecture) and expects you to know confusing notation that was barely taught","404":"Lectures can be pretty boring\/dry, but the content is gone over well both in lecture and discussion. There is more than enough practice for the exams from the discussion sections even though he does not provide practice exams. Exams are pretty straight-forwards.","405":"Jason is easily the best prof i've had here so far.\r\n\r\nPROS: \r\n- lectures are engaging and slides have extensive explanations (he goes at a good pace and occasionally stops to answer questions, has his TA's in the lecture so they can reach all the students w\/ questions efficiently)\r\n- exams are very fair (95% is loose variations of problems from lecture\/quizzes\/HW, 5% is a challenge question)\r\n- jasons a solid guy -- pretty funny, caring, etc. (really wants to set up his students for success in 351 and other upper levels) \r\n- i personally like the math part of cs more than the programming & found the logic\/proof aspect of the material in 250 very interesting, and jason presented it in a pretty clear way.\r\n\r\nCONS:\r\n- the grading with this class can be annoying occasionally, i remember losing 10-15 points on HW's for small mistakes here and there, but the TA's are solid with accepting regrade requests\r\n- his daily (or hourly lol) elms announcements can get annoying but thats really just because he doesn't want anyone to fall behind\/forget about an assignment\/exam","406":"Great guy who seems to truly care about his students.  Interesting lectures","407":"Jason is a really nice professor. He is extremely approachable, he makes jokes in lectures, and his lectures are extremely thorough and easy to follow. He likes to break them up with a small check your understanding type question and does his best to walk around the classroom and answered questions. That being said this is not an easy course. This requires a lot of work and studying. \r\n\r\nHis exams tend to be hard and such that if you mess up one question bad you look at a B. His grading is fair, and I never felt like I lost more points than I should have, but the class was challenging. It makes you think in a way most of us are unfamiliar with doing. \r\n\r\nIf you go to office hours, he will do his absolute best to answer your questions, and I always left feeling better. \r\n\r\nGO TO DISCUSSIONS -- DISCUSSIONS ARE IMPORTANT they will go over practice problems exactly like the homework WHICH HELPS A LOT and they also will go over material Jason will not cover but expects you to know, or will reiterate material that was complex and confusing in lecture. The TAs are really helpful.\r\nThe class is hard, but Jason is really nice. I highly recommend taking his class if you have to take this course. ","408":"i'M a cOLLeGe sTuDeNt aNd i sTiLL eXpEcT eVeRyThiNg tO bE sPoOnfEd tO mE.\r\n\r\nbro pick up a book, hop on google, jason is a fine professor.","409":"Really really good lecturer. Class was properly tough. Kinda scary though","410":"This professor sent an email to his entire class of 250+ people saying \u2018all lives matter\u2019, more than 2 weeks after the course ended. This is in the midst of the nationwide civil unrest following the death of george floyd in 2020. ","411":"Great professor. Always prepared for class and puts in so much effort into them. Did have some crazy things happen this semester but Jason honestly tried his best and students needed to cut him a little slack as it's been challenging all around. One of the most detailed and organized professors, I never was confused about what was going on. Sometimes he does make mistakes during lectures but he'll correct it if someone points it out. It was a hard class in general though, unless you pretty much already know what's going on. Grading can also hit hard too with grading proofs and stuff, but there are regrade requests. Acceptable workload and all the assignments were helpful for the exams. Really enjoyed his class and I appreciate him and his class a lot.","412":"You would think Sekora may be understanding as he is relatively young. But the class was very unorganized. With his method of updating slides for classes, there is absolutely no way to being able to keep track of the order. David also makes quizzes and exams much harder than what he goes over in class, and doesn't even bother to touch on problems that my give students an idea of how to apply them to other situations. He explains concepts, and sends us off expecting you to be able to handle any situation. He is terrible at writing problems as well, where he writes them in a way they could be interpreted several ways, where he would like a very specific answer which usually doesn't relate to any problems he does. Overall, trash teacher and do not sign up. ","413":"I'll offer a differing opinion, as these reviews seem to skew negative. \r\n\r\nCourse work was difficult but manageable. As the course was asynchronous, homework was often used as a way of developing understanding & building intuition. Quizzes were straight-forward (just checking that you understood\/paid attention to the lecture). Exams were difficult but David gave ample time for each (24 hours for the first, 48 for the second, 72 (I think) for the final). \r\n\r\nDavid wrote interesting problems and explained concepts well. He was a bit overly reliant on slides, which, in my opinion, aren't conducive to a productive learning environment. Having said that, most piazza posts were answered quickly or at least by the next morning. Occasionally, answers were curt\/dismissive (fairly, in my opinion), but, mostly, answers were in-depth and helpful. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, David gave a ton of partial credit and dropped enough quizzes and homeworks to potentially curve substantially. If you are not good at self-learning, you may struggle. Be warned, however, that self-learning will only be further emphasized as you continue through college. \r\n\r\nGiven all of this, I think David is a fine teacher and will only become better as he gains more experience. He clearly wants his students to do well. It may be difficult, but don't confused difficulty with malevolence. ","414":"Very hard class but his explanations made them doable. Exams were timed, but not on Zoom.","415":"I took this course in Spring 2020\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n+ It is extremely obvious that he is passionate about class content. lecture is never boring.\r\n+ At the end of the day, he does care about student long term understanding and success.\r\n+ Pretty funny at times.\r\n+ Transparent about how he grades questions, and what the curve will be.\r\n+ Lecture content is extremely digestable.\r\n+ Is quite adaptable to extenuating circumstances.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Has made unprofessional announcements which increased everyone's stress levels (if you took the class when I did, you know what I am referring to). If he has problems with individual students, then he should email them individually.\r\n- Partial credit is sporadic, sparse, and brutal. On proofs, you can lose 5-7 points immediately for not explicitly stating certain statements. Likewise, some probability problems will cause you to lose 10 points for calculation mistakes, even if your work is correct. In his defense, you may know about these ahead of time, but it's still frustrating to lose a significant amount of points for little things.","416":"Even though it was his first time teaching this course, he was very knowledgable about the material and his lectures were very interesting and helped prepare us for exams. ","417":"Class was challenging but very doable and I learned a lot. The grading was very fair and lenient in a lot of cases. Office hours were very easy to go to.","418":"His name is actually Jason, I don't know why he has a different name here. He is a very passionate and caring lecturer, one of the few that you will come across. He is a millenial, so he will talk to you like a big brother. I took him in Spring 2019 when we went into online classes and thought that he did a great job of teaching. A lot of people had problems with his communication style and complained about him to the department but he was definitely worth my tuition unlike Dr.Yoon. I wouldn't sweat about his long e-mails etc. Take him, he is a great lecturer. His communication channels and methods can be confusing sometimes so that would be feedback to Jason from me. Jason, please keep your communication short and perhaps use piazza since campuswire wasn't any better.","419":"Good lecturer, and explained the topics well, which are important to know. However, online transition was rough. Hard hws and exams, and send emails that berated us. He also downcurved our grades when clearly the opposite should have happened. However, he was getting a lot of abuse from jerk students in the past who felt entitled to a good grade no matter what, so it's not completely his fault; he just cracked. Future semesters should be smoother. ","420":"Justin was a lifesaver during Zoom U. He was very knowledgeable and taught everything clearly. He was very good at engaging with his s tudents during lecture and they could ask questions. 100% the best professor in the CS\/Math dept.","421":"Anyone who thought Jason was a lousy professor was simply caught lacking. His lectures are great and the topics are explained well and the HW and exams are not that hard if you've paid attention to the lectures and done the practice problems in the textbook. Yeah if a majority of the class does badly on an exam or HW he will say \"wow you all got rekt\" or something like that, but it's all in good fun and very clearly not meant to be hurtful. I think y'all are just mad because he made you realize your late-night cram sessions aren't a good way to study and you lost sleep for no reason. Don't slander his name because you got caught lacking.","422":"Jason is a great CMSC 250 teacher. He explains the concepts well and his lecture slides are very descriptive towards the process and logic behind every topic. Jason is very open to feedback and wants his students to succeed even providing extra credit opportunities and video announcements relating to the course. On the topic of Jason he is very down to earth and tries to connect with the students. It's always a good time in his lectures and I look foward to meeting him in person once fall opens up!","423":"Jason's lectures are amazing. He is very thorough with his explanations and examples, and he makes an effort to make his lectures engaging. His slides are very detailed. There is a lot of HW, but it is manageable if you don't start it on the last day and all of it really helps with the exams. He is very caring about his students and adjusts the course to fit his students' needs.","424":"Say what you will about CMSC250 but I think Jason makes the course all the more enjoyable. The course is difficult (hence my grade, which is due in part to slacking off for the first exam) but Jason explains the material in multiple ways which is extremely helpful. Additionally, there are many resources that are available in the class that exist solely to make the life of students easier. He is a very sarcastic and frank individual, so if these characteristics in a professor don't bother you then Jason is a perfectly acceptable option for this course. Something I wish I had known earlier on was the GSS sessions and  1-on-1 tutor sessions available through the Iribe (ask your counselor). These became especially useful when office hours were full or you're someone who just needs more personalized help. ","425":"One of my favorite professors now. The class is difficult and I definitely could have done better on the exams, but Jason explains everything so well.\r\nHe and his TAs were always quick to respond to student concerns, and he made adjustments to the syllabus throughout the weeks to better accommodate everyone.\r\nHe's easy to communicate with and he always gives a straightforward answer when you ask him questions in office hours.\r\nOverall I would recommend him to anyone trying to take the course.","426":"Pretty difficult course overall, but Jason explains things pretty well and is very receptive to student concerns. TAs are also awesome for this class. Exams are also very fair and were pretty generous, including a 24 hour submission window. ","427":"Extremely well recommended. The course was difficult, and I definitely could have done so much better in the class in hindsight, but Jason did extremely well explaining concepts and taking time out to go through student questions and concerns and address them to the best of his ability. He and the TAs did an extremely good job helping us as students and doing their best to provide us a better experience in the course. Exams and quizzes were graded on time, we had a 24-hour window to submit exams which was extremely helpful, we had recordings of lectures and lecture slides available to us, and Jason created a spreadsheet complete with resources, discussion links, relevant textbook sections, etc. All in all, I had a pleasant experience with the course, and would recommend taking Jason as a professor. :)","428":"Difficult course, prepare to be challenged a lot. If you don't understand a concept fully, ask questions. If something doesn't click for you properly, it will not go well for you on exams. \r\n\r\nJason is a fine teacher. He explains everything well though at times it can get a little bit confusing and wordy, discussions and homework were also really helpful to fully understand concepts. Jason tries to relate to his students a lot and he's sort of like the elder brother you never had. He definitely keeps it real with his students. ","429":"Jason's a really good professor. Yes the class is difficult, but that's to be expected. If you're having trouble with concepts, talk to Jason or the TAs in office hours. Jason's easy to talk to and he always keep it real. He also released additional videos outside of lecture to help us understand concepts that we're struggling to pick up. In short Jason really did everything he could to ensure we had a smooth semester.\r\n\r\nAlso quick shout-out to the TAs. They were all phenomenal.","430":"Phenomenal course. The course was organized amazingly well. Major kudos to the whole team (Jason + TAs). You learn a lot and you get to practice weekly with homework and quiz to solidify your knowledge. Sadly, I don't think Jason will be back to teach again.","431":"Great guy","432":"impeccable hair, 10\/10 teacher","433":"Solid professor, super nice. Couple times had some confusing examples and lectures but super understanding with student concerns","434":"Amazing teacher. Super engaging and explains everything really well. He handles any student questions really well too, not only answering them but going into depth so everyone gets a better understanding. Uploads the notes for the class so you can see everything and review it. In addition, he has his own typed up LaTeX notes he uploads which are also really good. Workload is good too, just a weekly assignment. Would highly recommend.","435":"Cliff teaches really well. He's young and relatable, his lectures are organized, and he does a great job of answering questions and clarifying on points of confusion. He seems like a nice person too. My only qualm would be with the class itself, which was that the homeworks often covered really complicated or difficult applications of what was covered during the lectures, especially towards the end of the semester.","436":"This probably doesn't need to be written again but Justin is one of the best at UMD. If you have the opportunity to take him, take him. Lectures were engaging and super organized. He provided all of the notes that he used for lectures. Exam expectations were very clear. Homework tracked well with the material in the lectures and was helped reinforce concepts. Everything was graded in a timely manner and everything was well communicated.","437":"Great lecturer, hard to pay attention at times with the 75 minute lectures but that's a personal problem. Only thing I can complain about is the absolutely atrocious organization of the course. Every released practice has at least 13 mistakes on the answer key, 50% of my homework had to be regraded because the TAs misread and marked my answers as incorrect when they were correct. Overall, probably one of the best lecturers out there but not great at organizing courses.","438":"First of all, his hair is amazing. Second, he is a really nice guy and he wants you to succeed. The co-taught with Justin WG this semester, and the exams were reasonable. Some of the homeworks were pretty difficult, but they are not impossible if you utilize office hours. I would recommend him!","439":"Fantastic lecturer, makes concepts easy to understand and apply. His notes on his website are a life saver and are remarkably thorough. His exams were fair and straightforward if you were prepared, and the homework problems were extremely relevant to the exams. Greatly enjoyed taking this class with JWG; even if math is not quite your thing, pay attention and do the homework and you'll succeed. Highly recommend.","440":"He is the GOAT! Take him at all cost!","441":"His rating speaks for itself. Take Justin if possible.","442":"Had Justin for MATH241 and used his notes for CMSC351 this past semester. He's the hardest working and probably best prof I think I've ever seen. Definitely take if you can.","443":"Cliff is amazing. 250 itself is hard but he made it as easy as possible to understand the material. 10\/10 hair and 10\/10 teaching.","444":"Lectures get a bit confusing at times, but he answers questions clearly. He\u2019s also very understanding and really wants everyone to succeed. Would take this class again if he were teaching it, if the material itself wasn\u2019t so confusing at the end o_o","445":"Great hair and a good lecturer who likes legos.","446":"Cringe professor. Tries too hard to be funny; has pointlessly stupid questions for quizzes that don't make any sense (i.e. one time there was an answer choice that says \"Proof by Human Exahustion\"), and for multiple choice questions you have to pick exactly all the write options and none of the incorrect options, or you will lose all points for said question, which makes no logical sense for someone who claims to be a \"logician\". Another time he said you have to answer 0 instead of \"63 choose 64\", even though they both equal 0 and are technically correct, simply because \"63 choose 64\" doesn't demostrate cRiTicAL tHinKInG. Choose him if you want to cringe for a semester.","447":"He does not read his emails, TAs are unresponsive. Assignments take forever to get graded and graded incorrectly a decent amount of times. Not great.","448":"He does not respond to emails. TAs are as unresponsive as him. They mess up grading and answer keys.","449":"Hard HWS but can do with friends. Generous to students about quizzes and exams. Lectures start off slow, but speed up. Never got too fast tho.","450":"Not very engaging as a teacher but gets the job done. Handwriting isn't the best so sometimes it's hard to follow, and examples in class aren't nearly as hard as the homework\/exam questions. Class is unorganized as a whole, as documents and solutions always seem to have some typo or mistake. TA's are not that helpful and sometimes can't answer certain questions. Grading is very poor, as graders often make mistakes when grading and it takes very long for assignments to be graded. Regrade requests aren't looked at for a long time as well. Cliff is an understanding and nice guy, who keeps the students' best interests in mind, but there are definitely many things that can be improved.","451":"The best I can say about Teli is that he is a good guy and he really cares about his students. However, this is only the second time that he has taught 250 and it really shows. His course materials are at least half a decade old focusing on subjects none of the other 250 teachers teach anymore. Additionally, notes and materials from other teachers are useless since he sometimes just makes up his own proofs. Teli also doesn't provide any detailed notes or practice exam materials which is very frustrating. His lectures are difficult to follow skipping essential material and making substantial mistakes in all of his example problems. The worst part is that his test, quizzes, and homework are extremely difficult and is completely different from anything he teaches in class. His grading is brutal and the TA often grades incorrectly so it's important to request regrades. \r\n\r\nOverall, I hope Teli gets better as he gains more experience teaching this class, but I cannot recommend taking CMSC250 with Teli at this time.","452":"Very boring and unorganized teacher. Don't expect anything graded for weeks.","453":"Cliff is a very understanding person, but he has very boring lectures, keeping me and others very disengaged. Handwriting is not good so it\u2019s hard to follow, and when it comes to grading, there will either be a lot of mistakes or grades just won\u2019t come out until a month after the assignment. ","454":"Great guy, terrible teacher. Cliff cares about his students, but the structure of the class and lectures was god-awful. There was seemingly little communication between him and the TAs, leading to a lot of misunderstandings and extremely delayed grading. Lectures were either incredibly trivial and boring or very confusing. Lectures also often didn't prepare us fully for the homework or exams. The grading was super questionable for everything, and almost everyone I talked to in the class submitted multiple regrade requests throughout the semester. Mistakes on seemingly every homework assignment were only fixed several days after being released. I actually learned most of the content in Discussion thanks to my GOAT TA. Cliff bases his lectures and content off of Justin's notes, but often presents them in a more confusing manner. The previous positive reviews were from when he co-taught the course with Justin, so I guess it was drastically different than this semester, because the general consensus is that this class was a mess.","455":"Cliff doesn't know the material he is teaching and recommends us to use Justin's notes because he even confuses himself during lecture. He didn't post lectures until weeks after the material was covered in class and in those videos, usually posted after the homeworks were due for that material, he would correct himself about something he said during the in person lecture. He didn't hold his TAs to any standard and he was very behind in grading and we had to go into every quiz and exam without knowing the grades of the relevant work we turned in weeks prior. He told us at the start that he came from a philosophical background and not CS and it showed. He would trip up on his wording and sometimes would scrap half of the work he was writing because he was lost himself. I would try to avoid him in future years if he ends up teaching anything more than 250 because I can't deal with being taught by someone who acts like a student themselves and can't stay on top of their own responsibilities. I know this was his first semester teaching on his own but it was even worse than I thought it could have went.","456":"Cliff has good intentions but is far from being a good, or even an average instructor. This was his first semester teaching and the class has been a disaster. Mistakes on every assignment, weeks to grade, slow responses - overall a really frustrating experience. His class was the worst organized class I have ever taken.","457":"DO NOT TAKE CLIFF!!!!\r\n\r\nConfuses himself in lectures, illegible handwriting, speedruns lecture slides in monotone, doesnt post lecture slides for weeks, takes 3 MONTHS to grade EACH homework, and once it is graded there are mistakes everywhere with autograding and TAs. The previous ratings were when he co-taught with Justin so he had high ratings, but now that he is on his own, he is beyond awful. Perhaps the worst class and lecturer I ever had. \r\n\r\nIf you are fine with not having half your homework, quizzes, and exams graded when you take your final exam and are fine with a disorganized monotone speedrunning professor with illegible handwriting then take this course.","458":"Don't take him. Period.","459":"Maybe the material just came quickly to me, but the organization of this class was a mess. I understand Cliff is young and stressed and new to teaching, but oh my\r\n\r\nTook about 2 months to get an exam graded, multiple questions were messed up.\r\n\r\nI am not joking when every single assignment\/homework\/quiz\/exam he gave us had some sort of mistake on it. I have never seen a group of TA's who have cared less about what they're doing, and honestly, it was extremely insulting. Every single homework had an issue with grading, as well as quizzes and exams.\r\n\r\n I understand that this isn't Cliff's fault, but it felt like my future in CS was being determined by his TA's who must've had their eyes closed while grading any assignment. It honestly felt like the entire team gave up halfway through.\r\n\r\nWith all that being said - He understands what he's doing. My guess is that he just needs time - AND NEW TA'S.","460":"Honestly has the potential to be a great teacher but is completely unorganized and seems like he doesn't care. Grades for assignments are not released until 2 months later which does not help you for exams or homework at all.","461":"Cliff's class is the most awfully organized class I have every taken. Nothing is posted on time: lectures, grades, etc. Good person, but highly overrated as an instructor because he co-taught with Justin. All of his content is recycled from Justin's material, and it doesn't even feel worth going to lecture. His practice exam for the final consists of a copy paste of the Exam 1 and Exam 2 practice exams, with like two additional questions, even when he stated that over half the final would be on stuff after Exam 1 and Exam 2. Probably because this was all the content available from Justin. It's overall a horrible experience to constantly be frustrated with nothing being graded properly, posted on time, having no idea what your grade is, and feeling like you aren't set up to succeed in the class. I would not recommend taking Cliff if there is a better alternative.","462":"immaculate hair but terrible class management","463":"Great person, horrible teacher. Every single paper or lecture has has a mistake, even answer keys and en exam. Don\u2019t expect to get scores back for anything until 2 months after you submitted it. Cliff doesn\u2019t look at Piazza doesn\u2019t post lecture videos until weeks after you need it. Terribly run class but I believe he has potential ti be great, just not anytime soon.","464":"Cliff is nice and understanding but his teaching style is very subpar. He's constantly unorganized and doesn't respond to emails. Although he records lectures to post online, he is constantly late and posts the material needed for homework on the day it's due. It seems he doesn't understand how to take responsibility and maybe that's because this is his first class he is teaching without help, but over the course of the semester, I started to realize that he continues to fall below normal standards.","465":"TLDR: Nice dude, poor teacher\r\n\r\n\r\nLook I want to be fair. Cliff is a nice person and I feel like he understands what we go through. With that said I really felt hopeless at time during his class.\r\n\r\nI didn't really understand these concepts until I started reading Justin's notes.\r\n(I guess that's sort of my fault, if I had looked at the notes earlier maybe I would have done better)\r\n\r\nHis lectures honestly jumped around a lot. When showing us steps he would sort of pull out solution from thin air.\r\nHe didn't show us the intuition and the though process behind what he was doing. This lack of clear steps really frustrated me.\r\n\r\nGrading wasn't great.\r\nHis examples in lecture don't go into enough details and so on exams and quiz's I would miss several points because of formatting or slightly different methods.\r\nThe grading was also inconsistent at times. \r\nSeveral regrade request were sent.\r\n","466":"Teli is a terrible professor. He doesn't teach us anything and the quizzes\/HWs don't match up to what we're learning at all. However, I must concede that he is experienced and knows the content. The exams were also rather reasonable. Only take Teli if you have to. And if you do end up taking him, buckle up.","467":"While there were a few snags this semester, Cliff clearly cares about the class and is doing his best for his first-time teaching independently. At most, the late turnaround on assignments and errors in grading were inconveniences, and did not impact my understanding of the class at all. His lecturing style worked for me, and I always felt set up to complete all the assignments just from just the lectures. Most of all, Cliff is simply the most compassionate and understanding professor I've ever had. People here put that in as an aside, but if some roadblock suddenly emerges mid-semester, you will be very glad to have Cliff instead of a more apathetic professor. Overall, I think it is only fair that we give Cliff the same level of compassion that he extends to us. Given that it's his first time alone and he's clearly trying his best, I'm willing to let a few things slide.","468":"Very disorganized class, grading was extremely poor, examples were convoluted, and it seemed that there was no consistent standard for how proofs should be written, as Cliff seemed to change his style at random between lectures. Would definitely recommend avoiding Cliff.","469":"Lectures might be a bit boring but all of the content you need to know for the exams is explained pretty well. Quizzes and tests were online and open-note for us which made them very stress-free.","470":"This class had the potential to be good. Cliff structured the course in a \"hybrid\" kind of way that was very understanding towards students\u2014lectures were-in person but basically everything else was online and\/or asynchronous. Homeworks were encouraged to be done collaboratively; quizzes and tests were open-note. Lectures are dull but not notably duller than any other 3-star CS professor I've had so far.\r\n\r\nIncredibly poor organization, however. Slow and inconsistent grading. Takes off points for style yet the lecture examples\u2014Cliff handwrites proofs and screen shares\u2014are a mess. I stopped showing up to discussion because my TA didn't seem to care about the content, and because what we were told in discussion didn't always line up with what we were told in lecture and\/or what was expected on graded assignments. The proof style guide was helpful but only for the first few units, and then it was no longer maintained.\r\n\r\nMost of my learning in this course came from provided practice material, which was okay in the beginning but once we started getting to more word problems\u2014proofs, statistics, combinatorics, etc.\u2014hilariously poor quality. Hilarious because if someone just proofread the material once, 90% of the problems could be fixed. They're obviously copied and pasted from other sources\u2014they'll be talking about pizzas one sentence and party hats the next, which isn't so bad until you try to check your work and they didn't even bother to change the answer key to match the new question at all. Answer keys are wrong or just plain irrelevant on a good chunk of the questions. Unclear phrasing and the questions can be interpreted many ways, which isn't great when they're expecting one solution. Ask three different people these questions and they're bound to interpret the question three different ways. I only grasped the combinatorics and statistics unit because of Justin's notes and through group studying in order to figure out what the question is really asking.","471":"Cliff's 250 this semester was quite an experience that could (and should) have been much smoother. As already mentioned, his biggest flaws are much mismanagement (having no work graded until 1 week before the final, including the second exam, very little explanation as to why points are taken off and what is expected, hardly responding to emails). A decent portion of my grade lost would be from assignments that I was not able to send or resend in time from not having a printer which stifled numerous questions on quizzes and exams. Additionally, there were some times when he muddled up material, or said things incorrectly and didn't follow a set standard that TAs may have graded. However, given that Cliff is a relatively new professor, and was handling 2 huge CS courses this semester, it seemed he did try to put a good deal of effort in both courses. In addition, the hybrid structure of in person lectures and exams\/quizzes being online was weird to adapt to and caused numerous issues, which is not Cliff's fault particularly. He definitely has a chance to grow and despite the problems, he did an alright job handling the teaching\/lecturing he needed to do this semester.","472":"Teli is strange. At the beginning of the semester, it seemed like he was a great professor, and that he and Cliff were keeping pace. However, it just got worse from there.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty, quality, and wording of his assignments vary wildly (both in between assignments of the same type and assignments of different types). This made it extremely difficult to productively study for exams and quizzes because I'd never be quite sure how they would flow.\r\n\r\nTeli also fragments course information across 4 different platforms (ELMS, Piazza, Gradescope, and his own UMD web space), and not all of these platforms send notifications. For the platforms that do send notifications, it is so hard to keep track of them and I have felt like I'll receive them a long time from when they were relevant (I have definitely missed a regrade window because of this fact).\r\n\r\nFinally, the TAs all had their own slightly different ways of doing things and interpretation of assignments, which I can only assume comes from lack of communication. This made grading inconsistent with different rules being applied to different assignments.\r\n\r\nTLDR: Do not take CMSC250 with Teli unless it is your only choice.","473":"CMSC250 with Cliff started off very well, but it ended with some noticeable flaws. This may be due to lack of teaching experience, miscommunication with the TAs, or some TAs slacking on their share of grading work. But PLEASE NOTE, I'm not considering class management in this review. Homework grading took a considerable amount of time, and there were often incorrect problems\/solutions in exam practice problems. Whether this was Cliff's fault or the TA's, this was a major issue that stressed out many students and must be taken care of for future classes. \r\n\r\nConsidering lectures, I thought Cliff was a solid instructor. Sure, some content could have been explained better, but Cliff made an effort and answered every question during or after lecture. I think the best way to prepare is to read Justin's 250 notes alongside regularly attending lecture. Other than doing the homework (yourself!), you should understand the general content. To me, lectures felt well paced and taught. Some content was boring, but well, it's 250. Just attend lectures and take notes and do your share of studying and you'll be fine.\r\n\r\nExams were fair. Quizzes were fair. Got extra credit opportunities sometimes.\r\n\r\nLike others have said, Cliff is one of the most understanding instructors. If you approach him and explain your situation, he will accommodate. Super nice and chill guy.\r\n\r\nI genuinely think that in a few years Cliff will be a top-tier instructor. Hopefully 250 will not have these issues with grading\/TAs moving forward. \r\n\r\nSide note: Cliff might keep exams\/quizzes online moving forward. Don't cheat with others. Not worth the risk and 250 content is important in later courses. You'll get imposter syndrome if you do.","474":"Immaculate hair, but his TAs are quite disorganized and grade inconsistently from each other.\r\nHis handwriting Isnt stellar so you have to pay extra attention to what he is saying and his lecturea overall arent too good for note taking since its almost all just examples, each being implement in a different manner. Regrades take ages and the autograder has had mistakes in almost every homework, 8\/11 if im counting correctly.","475":"Solid guy, seems pretty chill. However, his teaching and course organization abilities are frankly dismal. Most assignments have errors in them, adding to that there would be grading mistakes for almost everything. Lectures are boring and hard to follow. The pacing of the material is extremely poor, with some lectures covering seemingly nothing important and others leaving many students confused. The worst part of the class, however, are the TAs. It is obvious that the TAs don't care about the class whatsoever, the discussions are poorly led and the TAs often give contradictory information. To do well in the class, students are forced to constantly haggle for points on blatantly ignorant grading. The material should be easy to understand but being in Cliff's section made this class far more stressful and difficult than it had any right to be. The silver lining is that Cliff is a new teacher and should learn from his mistakes as he gets more experienced, oh, and he has cool hair... I guess.","476":"I took Cliff in the Spring of 2022, and I probably have a totally different experience than everyone else. Cliff was a super flexible guy who cared a lot about his students, and he did try to set us up for success. I believe the downfall of the course was the disorganization and laziness of most TAs throughout the semester as the grading had a lot of errors for people with it being inconsistent as well (since everything was online). There were a lot of errors on assignments as well, which I hope Cliff is more cautious of next semester. However, i never really got affected by any of this and I really did enjoy and felt like I learned a lot in this class. Cliff offered tons of OH, and I know some cannot make it to OH, but i found it to be super helpful I could come anytime to OH whenever I had a question, and I would say all the in person TAs were super helpful this semester over the ones online. I will stand by my 5 star rating because I thoroughly enjoyed the class, I never had anything wrong happen for me, and Cliff (and all In person TAs) were super helpful to me this semester to learn discrete math. If you are willing to just get out of your bubble and try to use the resources Cliff gives you to the best of your ability, the class isnt too bad. Some materials that really helped me in the class was: The lecture slides, IN PERSON OH, Justins Notes, the recommended textbook, discussion slides and recordings from some TAs, and answer keys for every single assignment despite the errors.\r\n\r\nI think Cliff will do a better job next semester and will eventually shape how he wants to structure his class in an organized manner soon.","477":"Pros: The class was entirely online and open note this semester so was not particularly difficult (stress load\/work wise). His exams are more or less fair although a bit of a time crunch.\r\n\r\nCons: This man is a genius in everything EXCEPT teaching. His lectures are straight from Justin\u2019s Notes (which carried me through the course), but the way he explains everything so disinterestedly makes them so hard to watch. Plus, the examples he provides in lecture are not well explained and incomplete. Honestly I ended up just using Justin\u2019s notes for most of the class and the only reason I watched his lectures were to make sure I was using the style he wanted for proofs. However, there was no point as he is EXTREMELY inconsistent in grading. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s him or his TAs. He goes back in what he says about style numerous times and the only reason I\u2019m even finishing with a B is the amount of regrade requests I submitted. \r\n\r\nOverall, the only positive about taking Cliff this semester compared to the other professor is that his class was online. I feel bad for whoever has him in coming semesters in person. I honestly don\u2019t know how I would pass the class with his terrible teaching and inconsistent grading . ","478":"Cliff is a great person and a decent teacher. He is definitely understanding of students' concerns and I feel that he teaches the material in the course properly (wish Cliff was more engaging though and enthusiastic). However, I think his management of the class was rather poor. Assignments were never graded correctly and very few TAs seemed to care about teaching the course material properly. There would be several times when a student had the correct answer and approach to solving a problem but would get graded incorrectly.  \r\nI think that through better management and more enthusiasm for the content, Cliff could easily become a great professor. He is young and has a lot of time to improve. Hopefully, the class will go much better next sem.","479":"I think some of the bad reviews that he is getting on here are a bit unfair (especially the comment about his speech impediment) considering how accommodating he was to students this semester. He made all quizzes and exams online, moved multiple quizzes because of upcoming exams in other courses, and was generous in providing make-ups. Also after students complained about it taking too much time to take the first exam, he made the second exam and final shorter and easier. Grade averages this semester were pretty high for this semester, so not much of a curve will be needed.\r\n\r\nFor the most part his lectures went at a decent, if not a tad slow, pace. However, there were certainly some issues in the structure of this course. Grades took a very long time to come out for many assignments, and many times the TA's made mistakes in grading. But they were all rectified with regrade requests. Overall, I do think that taking this course with Cliff is a good experience, and I thought that all-around he was a very solid professor. There is no doubt that he truly cares about his students and wants them to succeed in his class. His luscious locks make attending lecture worth your while.","480":"People are correct about his disorganized class, but I think he still is a great prof to take. All exams and quizzes were online which was nice, and the overall was just a great and accommodating person. His lectures were tough to understand at times as his handwriting is pretty horrible. If he continues to keep the content online take him, if not then run. ","481":"While very knowledgeable about the topics the class was pretty bad. Quizzes had random content at times but exams were ok. Try to avoid taking him if you can.","482":"Just gonna say, this class was so rigged and I'm so glad I'm out of the woods. Most people cheat and screw others over by making the exams have an unusually high average. Cliff is nice but also delusional when it comes to this issue. It was survival of the fittest\/\"get a high grade by any means possible\" all semester long.\r\n\r\nThe exam reviews were not that helpful and were recycled from last semester. Additionally, we were given wrong answers for them. I felt like two of the TA's at office hours took more of the role of professor than Cliff did in lecture. Can't even read his hand writing because he uses a super  pixelated drawing program. \r\n\r\nHe also took out learning about logic circuits from the class which really sucks considering this is a computer science course it'd be nice to know about those.\r\n\r\nJust be prepped to be at office hours regularly and maybe you'll do okay. ","483":"really bad organization of the class","484":"To do well in this course, study Justin's notes. For quizzes and exams, showing how you got the answer is important and you will lose points. However, Cliff doesn't teach how to do it, he just scribbles all over the board leaving the class confused. His class is manageable, but I would rather take it with someone who grades harder and teaches better.","485":"dude, i cannot understand what shes saying, and ive been around thick asian accents for my whole life. she does write on the board in a very explanatory way but she erases what shes written after like 10 seconds. would avoid","486":"I had Emily during the summer 2022 after completely failing 250 in the spring with Cliff. His teaching style just was not for me. But Emily she is godsent idk why there isn't more reviews for her . She clearly explains the topic in depth and does several examples to make sure you are ready to do the homework. Around exam time she does have a review session with practice problems I encourage you to go to them! Overall she is the best professor for 250 because she does not try to trick you at all and makes sure you understand the topics. Side note talk to her about anything Nintendo related especially Pok\u00e9mon you'll have a blast having a conversion with her.","487":"The best professor\/TA to learn 250 from next to Justin. If you see Emily teaching 250 I encourage you to take it with her. She is a godsent for this class! She makes sure you understand the topic and does a fair amount of examples. Also please attended the review session around exam time they are so helpful and can clear any problems you are having. There sure be more positive reviews for how good she teaches. Overall if she is teaching or being a TA go to her!!!! Also talk to her about Nintendo things especially Pok\u00e9mon makes for good conversation.","488":"Nice guy, explains every concept and topic really well. Exams and quizzes can be tricky, and the homeworks are graded extremely harshly for some reason. My main pitfall is that he's not super great with responding to emails or anything like that, took him almost a week to respond to my email about rescheduling an exam I had to miss due to COVID. Otherwise pretty good professor!","489":"Nice professor. Lecture is pretty nice, but can get boring at times. Harsh grading, though.","490":"Telli is a great professor:\r\n- Comes to class with a ton of energy,\r\n- Always willing to help and spend an hour if need be to clarify\r\n- Quizzes aren't bad actually, rules of inference\/proofs is the only thing I should've doubled down on\r\n- Tests: are hit and miss but overall, I'd say they are decent and cover everything equally\r\n- HW: In the beginning of the year, very long and tedious but later in the year, dirt easy.\r\n- TAs: Mine was ok, but definitely be sure to learn his\/her style.\r\n- Teaching: Good pace, lots of explaining, and writes the notes in real time so you can see the mechanics.\r\n\r\nOverall, Telli is an amazing professor with a great heart. I am taking him again in CMSC 320. He is a professor you want to stick around with.\r\nI hope this review helps!\r\nHarshit Garg","491":"It's important to keep in mind that Paul's first semester teaching CMSC250 was for a class shared with Cliff Bakalian, so his class inherited much of the same, notorious issues that Cliff is known for (frequent grading discrepancies, disorganized structure, delayed feedback on submitted work, inconsistent expectations, etc.).\r\n\r\nHowever, Paul lectures are solid and always conveniently recorded online. He will provide generous accommodations to students who need them, and engages with the class on a frequent basis. I can see him becoming a solid lecturer for CMSC250 once he has full charge of his own class.","492":"Cliff is an alright choice for 250. He's not amazing at explaining new concepts but not terrible either. Tests were pretty easy, though, especially when compared to the homeworks. Not a bad choice by any means.","493":"CLAIM: Emily is the absolute best teacher ever.\r\n\r\nPROOF by contradiction: First, we will assume Emily is not the absolute best teacher ever. Emily breaks down concepts and explains them very clearly. It's obvious she goes above and beyond to make sure every student can do the best that they can. Despite being a busy grad student herself, she is always very consistent, gives us feedback quickly, responds to emails, and more. Moreover, I can definitely tell she deeply cares about the success of her students, thus, proving a contradiction.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend everyone to totally, definitely, absolutely take her.\r\n\r\nQED","494":"She's just not a good teacher. I'll agree she's a very understanding person and I like her exam style, but we should have gotten way more out of 351 than we did. I didn't enroll in 351 to hear Meesh talk about random stories from her life for the entire class. It's great when professors can provide relevant anecdotes to the material that they're teaching, but Meesh just provided anecdotes about whatever happened to pop into her strange mind at the time.\r\nAt least the class is really easy though. I mean we only had 4 hws and one small project, which just goes to show you how little we learned.","495":"This was my second time having Meesh. She is complicated. I'm a firm believer that a professor is not defined purely by his or her lecture skills, and since she's not your average professor, I have to break this down a little.\n\r\nLectures: Tough to follow. If you learn purely through lectures, you might want to avoid her classes.\n\r\nExams: Long, but fair. She does not penalize you very much for missing small details. Just don't ever get caught up on one problem. If it takes you too long, skip it.\n\r\nHomework and projects: Also pretty fair. She doesn't seem to believe in secret tests. She isn't as forgiving about stupid mistakes on homework as she is on exams.\n\r\nAccommodations: Seriously amazing. Is your life hard? Do you have other things going on? Do you mess up sometimes, and does that one bad day sometimes ruin your entire grade for a class? Congratulations, Meesh acknowledges that you are human! That test you took half-asleep and sick and stressed beyond belief? Dropped. That homework you couldn't do because you had so much going on outside of this class? Dropped. That day you have two projects due and two homework assignments due and two exams? Meesh is the professor who will give you an extension.\n\r\nDisabilities: If you have any sort of disability it is really nice to have a professor who understands. Meesh will be the first person to realize that you're not stupid; your brain just works differently. ","496":"really guys! I am puzzled, how could anyone give Meesh 5 stars?? Granted her \"lectures\" can be entertaining but you don't learn anything. She just sits on her fat ass and tells you stories. Her rare efforts to actually teach result in a tirade of nonsense. The only times I've learned anything in her class are when the TA took over.\n\r\nShe often comes to class late, and occasionally even misses the entire class. She doesn't even write up her own notes. \n\r\nI am a math, physics, and cs major and in all my classes I've learned one thing - that the CS department needs to do an overhaul of their professors. And the first thing they should do is fire Dr. Hugue.","497":"Vibha is an incredibly...alright professor.\n\r\nShe obviously knew the material for algorithms, her speech can be understood with no problems, and she is fairly excited about the content. She did a better job explaining the more abstract material, but for more concrete explanations, she wrote down the problem before hand, and copied them onto the board. This is a problem, because then she had no pacing. She went too fast during hard parts and too slow during easy parts. This was by far her biggest problem.\n\r\nShe's also a bit harsh on students who make mistakes (for example, failing to take good notes and looking for other ways to get the content). However, this seemed to improve over the semester.\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend taking another professor if you have the opportunity (for example, Kruskal for 351, whose lectures, when I attended, I felt I learned more from), but, if she's you're only option, she's not terrible.","498":"She was ok as a teacher. She clearly doesn't have as much mastery of algorithms as Golub does, but she actually attempts to make a boring class interesting with jokes and humor, which is quite a job in itself. Overall a pretty fair teacher, even giving points back when they were deserved on tests and homeworks. Definitely one of the liveliest teachers I've had in CS classes.","499":"Vibha is an excellent teacher. She keeps class interesting and is always animated in her discussions. She answers questions clearly and concisely and presents material, even somewhat complex mathematical proofs, understandably. It is a shame she is only teaching CMSC351, so I may not get another chance to have her as a teacher.","500":"Golub was a terrible professor. It was extraordinarily difficult to pay attention in his class because he talked about the material in such a fluffy way.\r\nThere was no concrete information on the slides, and the copies that he put online were half complete and didn't show the work he wrote in class.\r\nAlso, he refused to put full solutions to homework and thought questions online, which made it very difficult to study by myself.\r\nOverall, I was extremely unhappy with how little I felt I learned from this course. You need a professor who can teach the material much more clearly and in a concrete way, not one where he blabs for half the class.\r\nI also don't feel that I learned at all how to apply the knowledge I learned from this class to anything I would see outside of this class.\n\r\nHe was also very strict and not willing to be accommodating of student concerns for the most part.","501":"This guy is the worst, one of the worst professors ever. Don't pay attention to any of the good reviews, they come from people who got good grades because of his \"curve\", who studied in groups and did the homework in groups. His curve only benefits people who do well on his exams. \n\r\nYeah...this class is easy if you study really hard everyday, attend every lecture, studying in a group, ask questions about everything, and pay attention to every little detail\n\r\nOtherwise if you don't do ALL of those things you won't get a good grade, now that's what an easy class is. You are technically not allowed to work together on homeworks but I'm guessing the good reviewers who studied in groups did anyway.\n\r\nYou basically have to study in groups or be very good at algorithm theory in order to get a good grade","502":"I don't know what the deal is with what ALMOST EVERYONE told me but this class has been fairly easy. One thing to note about this class (which is perhaps why I found it easy) is that the material that you learn is actually extremely relevant to the field of computer science. If you tackle the material with that attitude you're bound to do much better in the class. I have had internship interview questions based on material learned in the class -- so learn the material any way that you can!\n\r\nThe only thing about Golub's class is that you need to be in lecture. You need to learn how he wants all of the problems' solutions to be set up -- exactly the way he does them in class. Do your best on homework and try to imitate his examples in lecture to get the best grade. Also, definitely do the thought questions -- get a study group. I can't stress this tip enough. His exams seemed to be based much more on the thought questions than the homework questions (how convenient..) -- and if you've done the thought questions, you're bound to ace the exam.\n\r\nGo to office hours if you are confused about something. He actually is very helpful in office hours (not necessarily in class), just make sure that you have notes from class because the first thing some of the TA's and Golub sometimes asks is \"okay, well lets look at your notes.\"\n\r\nIf you do miss a class make sure to get the notes from someone else. If you miss some classes you can still get away with an awesome grade, but if you miss even a single one of the classes where he discusses critical material, you're grade will drop like a rock unless you have access to someone else's notes.\n\r\nAll three of our midterms were pick 4 out of 5 questions. It was not this way in the past semesters (not for all 3 exams anyway) so don't bank on it, but it did make the class a hell of a lot easier. He also tells you he weighs grading as follows: 17% per exam, 14% homeworks+quizzes+projects, 35% final. For us, he changed it to 12% lowest midterm, 17% middle midterm, 22% best midterm, and for the homework section (which totalled 150 pts), he took the score out of 125 instead. \n\r\nHe also seems to curve exams arbitrarily..but everyone else has already touched on how he curves. Our first exam was taken out of 88 points, our second was 95, and third 97 or so. I would have expected a much higher curve for the second exam, which makes me wonder where he gets his numbers from (the 12 point curve on the first exam was unnecessarily high, but I'm not going to complain).\n\r\nAlso, the book is unnecessary.\n\r\nI would have given him 4 stars but if you try to ask him questions right after an exam even if it's unrelated, he will yell at you. He is also very condescending sometimes. Even if you have a legitimate question he will cut you off and say \"I'm not answering those questions right now\" or \"I can't solve new problems for you right now\" or \"that's not relevant to the topic\" even if a) it's a general conceptual question, b) you're not asking him to solve a new question, and c) it is relevant to the topic. Golub many times (not always) assumes that his students are idiots and comes off as being extremely mean and as someone else has said, his head can be very far up his ass.\n\r\nFinally, when you're taking a test, make sure to get your question across if you have a legitimate question. Many times the TA's too (and Golub) may think you're fishing for the answer even when you're not. This has happened so many times it makes me want to smack them and tell them to listen to my damn question before cutting me off. You're basically on your own.\n\r\nAlso I don't know what the other people are smoking who gave him 5 stars. I ended up with ~99.5% (so it's not like I'm biased against or bitter about his grading) in the class and I still think he was not a very \"patient\" and \"approachable\" and friendly guy who cared for his students...","503":"I don't see where the hatred stems from. All the negative reviews about this guy and all the complaints about how ridiculously tough the material is - is complete bullshit.\n\r\nI am by no means, a top student. I merely got a B in CMSC250, and that was with a curve. I found this class to be somewhat enjoyable and predictable in terms of what would be on the exam.\n\r\nI agree with the guy below me, form study groups. Most of the \"lone warriors\" ended up failing the course, or barely passing with a C.\n\r\nIf you honestly go to all lectures, office hours, and do all the homework problems and thought questions intuitively, then you have no problems getting a B or higher.\n\r\nThe guy was nice enough to curve exams (although randomly and not by much) and drop 25 hw points.\n\r\nVerdict: Go to every class, attend office hours if you sincerely get stuck, form a productive study group, and do ALL the homework and thought questions. Assuming you aren't the type to choke during exams, you should net a relatively A or B.","504":"This course is pretty easy in my opinion. Especially if you found cmsc250 easy, this one is similar. However, the professor himself is a total loser and a-hole. First of all, he thinks he's the smartest person alive, talking about how he can do pretty much any proof alive and how him and his friends go around cracking systems. He will tell you countless stories every class about how he outsmarted one thing or another. It's funny one kid told me about how we should do a drinking game where everyone takes a shot whenever he boasts about himself.\n\r\nOf course, all professors have some ego but that is not why he's a terrible professor. He can be excessively rude and repressive during lecture and office hours, up to the point where he will yell at you if you ask a question he finds trivial. Personally, I went to his office hours once to explain how he did a certain proof, and he yelled at me, \"okay you are not doing this the way i mentioned in class, you have to pay attention!\" Forget about even asking any tangential questions, because he will automatically shoot down anything that's not related to the topic at hand. His default response: \"we're not talking about that. see me in office hours.\" Also if you approach him with your own problem and ask him to solve it, he refuses to do so out of concern that others won't get a chance to see the solution.\n\r\nAs other people have mentioned, he does not post up lecture notes or worked out examples, so you must attend class or get notes from someone else. the only good thing i have to say about the class is that his exams are reasonable and predictable; there is very little deviation from his homework and thought questions. Also, he is generous in that he allows you to answer 4 out of 5 questions and curves each exam score. I was able to coast through this course with an easy A, but I still hated the professor.","505":"Okay number one if your major is computer science you should be expecting hard courses. The teacher is a great teacher, provides plenty of extra help and if you DO NOT wait until the day of the exam you can get plenty of help. He will explain something as many times as necessary until you completely comprehend the topic. He does not post his in class notes online because he wants to encourage student to attend class and once again if you are a computer science major you should not be looking for the easy way out. The class takes place in the afternoon so there is no excuse to not attend class. His Homework\u2019s are fairy difficult however, if you email him or seek help during his office hours he will provide you plenty of help and clues. His test can be Extremely hard or Extremely Fair, it\u2019s all based on how much you have actually learned. It is not impossible to get an A in his class. Also, he is very patient, approachable and does not make you feel stupid for not understanding a topic. Also, he cares about his students!!!!\r\nI would recommend him to other students.\n","506":"Such a lovely person. He's always so nice and smiling to you whenever you talk to him. \n\r\nHe made such a amazing adjustment for the percentage distribution to try to help the class.\n\r\nHe has a unique way of encouraging students to go to his class and office hours, yet it's really helping people to understand and learn the material.\n\r\nDidn't really appreciate what he did in the beginning of the semester but now I understand why and am truly grateful.\n\r\nUnlike some of the CS professor, he's friendly and approachable.\n\r\nPeople whoever don't want to make any effort and slack off but still hope to pass better not take his class.","507":"This guy's head is so far up his own ass that he can see out his mouth.\n\r\nHe has made 351 to fail you. This is one of those courses where you will have to come to his office hours or the TA's office hours if you want to actually learn anything. If you do show up for office hours, don't expect to get help for about an hour because EVERYBODY ELSE is also trying to get help. Good luck.\n\r\nHis slides are absolutely useless. For whatever reason, he does not post his written examples online. Make sure to take good notes. He will do examples in class on his fancy shmancy Tablet PC, but not post them afterwards.\n\r\nHe posts extra assignments and examples online, but again, he does not post solutions. Same deal with the homework: NO SOLUTIONS ARE POSTED EVER. This alone makes the course hell for the math illiterate. You want to learn from examples and build up your confidence, but you can't because you have NOTHING to work off of.\n\r\nExams are generally based off the homework and his \"thought questions,\" the extra problems he posts online without solutions. Don't expect any extra help with those exams because he doesn't post sample exams. (If he did, they probably would come without solutions. So useful.) Of course, how he expects you to master some of theses proofs after one or two examples is beyond me.\n\r\nHis exam grading policy is the worst. If you get a problem wrong, you will lose almost all the points if you don't lose them all. Don't expect points for effort. You can write out an elaborate proof and get maybe a couple of points for it.\n\r\nAnd then his \"curving\" system...\n\r\nSince he's all into his mathematics, he \"curves\" by dividing your exam grade by a decimal he magically calculated or pulled out of his ass which is now also his mouth. Now your simple arithmetic abilities should tell you this is an issue. If you got a 100 on the exam with a curve of .90, you'll enjoy an extra 11 points. If you're the unfortunate guy that only got say a 50 on the exam, you get a mere 5 extra points. So if you do well on an exam, you get an extra boost. If you're already failing, expect to be failing even more. The rich only get richer in his world.\n\r\nThis guy always talks about how he's \"clever\" yet he doesn't do a damn thing to endow his students with his \"clever\"-ness. This guy is incompetent as a teacher. Just dodge him for your own sanity.","508":"This is the worst professor ever\n\r\nThe book does not cover the material on the exams\n\r\nThe slides also do not cover the material on the exams\n\r\nAll of his posted examples are either half of the problem or very unclear and vague\n\r\nAll of the most important real work he does in class on a note pad for a few minutes but he never posts these notes online on the slides at all, instead he just assumes you get it\n\r\nYou are not allowed to study together on homeworks or use notes from online\n\r\nThis makes this class nearly impossible to study for\n\r\nOverall, one of the worst experiences so far","509":"Oh Golub...\n\r\nHis lecture notes aren't the best in the world. He'll show how to do a proof on his Tablet PC...but not post those notes online. Sure it discourages the class-skippers but what about those who actually take notes and need to review them? He might have the occasional \"generic\" proof posted online but thats about it.\n\r\nHis exams are painful but doable. The biggest thing is reviewing all those homework\/thought questions he gives and manipulating them. Practice practice practice!\n\r\nOne of Golub's bright spots: He'll happily answer \"any\" questions in class. If you missed something in the examples he does, he'll gladly go over it again until you get it. Please don't be asking \"what-ifs\". He often cut you off.\n\r\nHe does curve the exams. Often it's drop a question and add a few points.\n\r\nWith the final exam, he'll give you about 12 questions and you only have to do 8 of them. They are grouped into sections...like a section of three questions, a section of two questions, etc.\n\r\nOverall Golub does know his material very well..but he's quite arrogant about it. He can be helpful but his teaching methods are questionable.\n\r\nAnd yes, he doesn't give much partial credit.","510":"As bad as the CS department professors are I would say Golub is the worst. \n\r\nTo start, his lecture notes are very bad. He hand writes his lecture notes on his tablet PC during lecture and says these will be online. The bad thing is that he works through a problem in class and doesn't put that work online. This is no help at all.\n\r\nHe post thought questions which are supposed to be sample like questions but he posts no answers or ideas about how to go about approaching them. You never really know for sure if you are even close to getting the right answer.\n\r\nHis exams are extremely hard. He does not have sample exams because as he says at the beginning semester \"He never really thought they were helpful\". Are you kidding??? If a question is worth 20 points you will only receive around 4 points for work if you are wrong. \n\r\nThere is so much more to say about this guys teaching that is bad. The sad thing is that in the past 4 or 5 semesters he is the only professor teaching 351 during the fall and spring so you are pretty much forced to take him. I think it is better to take this class during the summer with someone else in my opinion!!!!","511":"As previously stated, Golub isn't the greatest professor the CS department has to offer, more like one of the worst I've had.  \n\r\nAs others said, he knows the material, but you never will.  Algorithms aren't for everyone, but he will make you regret taking the class in the first place.\n\r\nHis notes are USELESS, and I mean utterly, supremely pointless.  He will give examples in class that are on the slides, yet he leaves out the actual answer.  He uses a tablet PC to do most of the lectures, writing in the answers to questions as he goes along.  He fails to keep those handwritten items in what he posts.  \n\r\nHis homeworks are difficult and you really have to take them head-first.  He doesn't post any practice exams, etc... NO answers posted to HW's, NO answers posted to his \"thought questions\", NOTHING.  So if you don't go to lecture, you will have no reference as to how to do the work.\n\r\nDespite all of this, office hours with him help a lot, but he still doesn't want to give you the answers to anything.","512":"His lectures are okay, but his examples can be a bit hard to follow.  It's not difficult to do well in his class, but some of his exam questions are overly difficult and can be vague in terms of what he is really asking.  No quizzes.  Were assigned eight homeworks throughout the semester.  Homeworks aren't too bad and are actually useful as a couple of homework questions were asked to me in job interviews.  He is very helpful during office hours and will go out of your way to explain things to you before and after class.  Make sure to do all of his \"thought questions\" and alter some of his homework questions to study for his exams.","513":"Golub is a guy who seems to mean well, but his flaws are pretty serious. For one his grading methodology is questionable at best. If you read the syllabus he claims to curve each assignment...but his curving method is random and mathematically suspect. For example, on one exam we were told to divide our scores by .8. The problem with this curve is it gives MORE of a curve to people with higher grades...seeming to violate the point of a curve. Another time he gave everyone in the class 5 extra points as a \"curve\" but admitted that he had not yet calculated the average. He will intermittently claim that he has to \"recheck his formulas for final grades\"...so basically he leaves your grade as one of his thought questions. I  finished the final for class yesterday, so the final grades aren't up yet, but it will be interesting to see what he does. I know kids who are brilliant and  very knowledgeable about the material who currently have Bs.\n\r\nThen there are the exams which give little to no partial credit, and somehow expect you to answer questions based on information that he doesn't give you. For example, when he says \"use the quantified definition\" somehow in Golub-speak this means \"use the quantified definition using an inductive proof\"...the later part being a crucial piece of information I wish I had.\n\r\nHis class is set up like a discussion. He gives you limited notes, and then you work out the details in class. This looks good on paper...but the problem is all those damn smart-ass CS kids who want to show off instead of letting everyone else learn. They'll derail him and let him think he can gloss over the details because everyone gets it already. Don't let him get away with this, shy people! Also, because his notes were so sparse and I'm a bad note-taker, I was affected negatively by his teaching style, but not everyone will have a problem with this.\n\r\nIf you want to do well in this class, you HAVE to come to class. His notes aren't going to help you. Trust me, come to this one. Also, see him in office hours if you can. This is kind of irritating to me, because this isn't feasible for everyone, but unless you have prior knowledge of the material, you're going to want to get extra hours with him to clarify some of his vague details (especially towards the end of the semester when the algorithms get weirder). Ask questions in class! He's more than happy to answer them. Also, submit regrades even if you have the slightest question about your exam. He will sometimes expect answers for questions he doesn't ask, and you can get those points back easily...once I got an exam bumped up a full letter grade because of this. He can be very stubborn about some things though...I know one student who had a log base 3 in one of his answers which golub argued with him for at least 5 minutes over whether it was a 2 or 3. ","514":"An awful professor. He really knows what he's talking about, but nobody else does. He is very stingy with grading and will give little to no partial credit.","515":"People really scared me into thinking Golub was a terrible professor. I don't think he is really that bad. However, you will need to goto his office hours if you don't understand something and make sure you practice the material. He is sometimes overly tough, but generally fair. For example for the first test this semester he gave us decimals and fractions all over the place. It was really just a pain in the ass more than a test of knowledge.\n\r\nHowever, he is a competent though not excellent teacher, and is more than happy to help you out during office hours.\n\r\nThat said though, he is not the sort of guy who will bump you up if he sees you in his office a lot or w.e. He will give you what you earn and nothing more.\n\r\nThat said, I abused notes from the previous semester with Bonnie\/Vibha's sections because Golub just has garbage for notes sometimes.\n\r\nSo, pro tip: look at Fall 07 section notes :)","516":"Golub does not really aim to prepare you in lecture for exams or homeworks.  After the first midterm I found myself ignoring his lecture notes and working entirely off of the other section's (taught by Bonnie Dorr and Vihba) posted notes.  Golub was also indeed stingy with grading, and people in the other section could get points back on midterms that our section could not get back via Golub.  I rather wish I had been in the Bonnie\/Vihba section.","517":"Clyde is actually very intelligent, and I found it fun to learn from him. While lectures aren't extremely helpful at the time of the lecture, going over the notes and understanding the semantics of every afterwards algorithm helps. Clyde will handwave some things in what he teaches because to him it's trivial. However if you go through the algorithms step by step, you can learn a lot and do well in the class. Overall the material was difficult, but the exams could be manageable given the right type of studying. ","518":"Dr. Kruskal is a terrible professor. For algorithms, he did not teach nearly as much as any other professor. Looking at material from other semester, he did not cover as much material NOR covered it as deeply. He would refuse to do proofs under the mindset that they were not instructive. Even when he did attempt them, the proofs were so terrible I didn't even bother writing them down. He would always be minutes late, and would often spend the last chunk of classes doing unrelated material further wasting time.\n\r\nThis being said, our semester also had many terribly harsh graders for TA's. The class up to the final was pretty straight forward. The midterm was not too difficult, and the weekly homeworks were usually doable and he accepted resubmissions (and very late submissions). The final exam was incredibly difficult and harshly graded. The mean was a 45, and the final cut offs for passing the course was a 37, and for an A-, a 67.\n\r\nIn the end, going to lectures and doing the homework is still crucial. He does not offer any other manner of learning the little he did go over in the semester, such as online notes, so not going to lecture makes getting a decent grade nearly impossible. I would not recommend him. He makes the class just as difficult as the other professors, but you end up learning less in the end. It might be a little less work with the somewhat small weekly homeworks, but it is not worth it in the end.","519":"If you're not into math, STAY FAR FAR AWAY. The lectures are incredibly hard to follow, but attendance is still imperative to have any chance of success. The homework is quite difficult and extremely time-consuming; expect to spend 8 hours per assignment and to get a low grade. There is no indication of what to expect or how to prepare for the exams, but fortunately they were tempered significantly to make them fit into the allotted time. They're not easy, but they're not impossible either, which is all-important since the two exams are 90% of the grade.","520":"Kruskal comes from a long line of brilliant mathematicians and he is no exception. However, he forgets that not everyone, especially undergraduates, are not as brilliant as he is. His homework assignments were vague and sometimes his lectures would go off on vague tangents.\n\r\nHis midterm and final were very difficult. Average for both was about a 50. Granted, his curve is mean + std. deviation is the B\/A line which is nice,  but still hard and stressful.\n\r\nIf he's your only option, you'll live. If you have other options, take them instead.","521":"The previous two reviews are probably accurate in the Clyde was frequently late, unprepared, and probably didn't care tremendously about the class. I won't lie. I hated the class while I was taking it. Didn't study enough for the midterm and did awful on it. Did really well on the final and ended up with an A-.\n\r\nLook. He is clearly passionate about the material and he is actually decent at explaining it. As much as I hate to admit it, both tests were fair. You got a certain amount of points if you understood the homework and you could figure out the other problems on the fly if you generally understood the material.\n\r\nAlso, do yourselves a favor. Don't spout out that CLRS is a useless book too loud. It really isn't.","522":"No syllabus.\r\nThe book is useless.\r\nHe scribbles random gibberish on the board. Those are your notes for the class. \r\nHis office is a mess, to say the least.\r\nHe doesnt give a damn. ","523":"Kruskal is a terrible teacher. He never showed up to teach on time, always being five to ten minutes late. He was even late to the final exam. He didn't post the chapters that went along with the material he taught in class, so your class notes were your only study source. I approached him about this and asked if there was any material in the book I could use, and he replied that nothing he taught was in the book. On several occasions he taught the wrong material. The class had no structure, either a student would remind him where he left off the class before, or he would just start in a seemingly random place. The average on the midterm was a 50%, with the standard deviation being 25%. This meant that the grades were so scattered, that a 75 was an A, a 50 was a B, 25 was a C, and 0 was a D. He was such a bad teacher he made it impossible to get an F in his class.\n\r\nTL;DR Kruskal is a scatterbrained, unorganized mess of a professor, and you should avoid him at all costs.","524":"Professor Kruskal was a good teacher for this class. Especially when you consider that Prof. Golub is the other option. Kruskal taught pretty well. I think an average student should have been able to understand most of the topics we covered. Though his tests are not easy. They are between average and hard. He curves grades like most comp sci classes. For this class, make sure you do his homeworks and the practice exams. Though tests may not be very similar to them, but they do help you build a strong foundation for the test. \r\nHe does show off his intelligence at times and can be slightly rude, but if you don't ask questions, you won't get much out of him any way. But he wants you to learn. Definitely recommended for CMSC351. He is after all related to the guy who came up with the famous Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm. :).","525":"I actually liked this course with Mohammad. Sometimes the homework seems impossibly hard, but just go to office hours with the TAs and you get through it much quicker. To get do well on the exam, just memorize the homework problems and study the lecture notes.","526":"Bonnie did an excellent job teaching CMSC351, which is not an easy course. Her style was very traditional but very effective. I would gladly take her again for any course.","527":"This class was one of the toughest algorithms classes I've ever had. Clyde is somewhat of a right of passage for UMD, but that doesn't make the class any easier. The professor is somewhat disorganized and gives bogus explanations for things, but you learn a ton about sorting\/selection algorithms and complexities in the worst case for most things.\r\n\r\nThe first midterm from this semester was brutal (and I heard harder than last semester), and the average was a 56% with a standard dev of about 15 pts. The second better wasn't too bad and had a 68% with standard dev of 15 pts.\r\n\r\nI've no idea how the final will be, but I know the class has become more lenient since 2010-2012, so I'm hoping not too bad. They'll apparently test you on MoM, graphs, minimum spanning trees, and np on the final. Good luck to anyone taking this class, and get a study group :)","528":"This man is terrible. His lectures are rambling, he is unhelpful, and he just doesn't give a flying fuck about you as a person. ","529":"Love the guy. He has an eccentric personality but if you get one on one time with him, get to know him and show genuine interest in the material, he is great. I retook this class after not passing over the Summer. Did much better the second time. \r\n\r\nIf you have to retake a second time, fear not. Nearly everyone who retakes Kruskal does even better the second time around because he doesnt change a thing. Hes a creature of habit. The addition of a second midterm in the semester has helped the class be more \"pass-able\". Clyde is probably the best option for 351. His exams can be daunting in terms of how hard it makes you think, but it mainly just recycles some home work problems with different numbers and one coding interview question.\r\n\r\nAfter getting a D+ the first time in the summer, I am expecting a  B- the second time around after the curve. It can be done!","530":"He was a TA for Kruskal in CMSC 351. Super friendly guy. Don't expect him to confirm your intuition or your answers, but that is a cardinal rule Clyde gives all his TA's (some follow it more leniently than others however). He can explain things better for you because Kruskals wording on his problems can go over your head some times. Theres no discussion sections in 351 so just rely to see him in office hours.","531":"Kruskal is one of the best professors I've ever had. Is he easy? No. But his style, for me, just fits.\r\n\r\nEverything he says has a logical purpose in the lecture. He not only explains everything that's done, but he also goes over it again if someone asks. He periodically stops and asks if everyone is following. If you are lost, and you aren't asking questions, that's YOUR fault. Not his.\r\n\r\nKruskal expects you to be intuitive. This may make some students struggle, but to be quite honest, it really comes down to how much work you put in to the class in order to gain that intuition on how to solve a problem.\r\n\r\n60% of every exam is basically regurgitated homework problems. As such, if you fail this class, you simply aren't putting in the time to nail down the homeworks to perfection.","532":"Taught me all I needed to know, he had no surprises on his tests and was a great resource when I had concerns about my grade. I failed the first test (like 20%), studied my butt off for the next 2 and the final and ended up with a B.","533":"I'd like to first clarify explicitly that this rating is of *the course itself* and my experience, and not Kruskal personally. \"Clyde,\" as I sometimes hear other students call him (not my style), is friendly, even solicitous, in person; although at times I was very frustrated with him I never had a bad impression of him as a person. \r\n\r\nBut almost everything else about the course, including his teaching style, left me unhappy and on-edge. Among other things, at the end of the course I received a grade better than a B - the night before, I had calculated the likely cutoff for a C-, because I was *that* unsure where my not-yet-graded final exam performance left me. A member of my friend-group was dumbstruck to receive a 50% on one exam (exams are far-and-away the bulk of your grade in this course), only to discover that he had been misgraded by about 30% - that is, he actually earned an 80. \r\n\r\nTo avoid going over-length with anecdotes, some key complaints\/corresponding survival tips:\r\n\r\n- TAs are perennially unhelpful (make sure you work with other students)\r\n- Exam questions draw heavily on homeworks, so successfully understanding homework (no matter how vague or slow-grading TAs might be) is important to get done before exams\r\n- Grading is slow and curves aren't specified until the very end (avoid panicking, and monitor where you are with respect to the average; for reference, 75% earned you an A in my semester)\r\n- Make sure you understand the rudiments of calculus (how integrals are approximated with sums, for example) and summation-handling, because this knowledge will be largely assumed in derivations\r\n- Our final exam was largely *not* cumulative, and what did show up was more trivia we'd all forgotten than anything substantive (all I can hint here is to take note of \"space complexity\" during the course)\r\n- TAs frequently pull the hardest exam questions from websites like \"geeksforgeeks,\" interview-type questions for professionals; studying at least a few of these will give you a fighting chance of solving the problems in real time\r\n- The textbook is sometimes helpful but always a pain to read; if you anticipate trouble, start reading in advance\r\n- This course often tends towards the frustrating; instead, try to have fun - really the best thing about this course is it encourages on-the-spot facility with making a good algorithm to solve a problem you encounter, which is a cool skill to have\r\n\r\nSadly, I could still say more, but I think I've gone on long enough. Kruskal's course by reputation teaches you more than others - I'd certainly say so - but the stress and the \"on-your-own\" attitude mean that you have to be aggressive about making sure you understand well enough and have enough practice to acquit yourself well on exams. Truthfully, I can't say I recommend Kruskal's 351 - only that it is survivable if you bite down from the start.","534":"Clyde is disorganized, and hard to communicate with for administrative issues.  He also gives the impression that he does not really care about his students.\r\n\r\nDespite this, I think he explains the content of the course adequately.","535":"Entertaining lectures and fun homeworks\/exams. ","536":"This class is difficult no matter who teaches it. It is obvious Kruskal is an algorithms wizard and it worth taking his class, even if it mean night exams and long homeworks. Office hours are a must for this course but more enjoyable because of Clyde","537":"Kruskal is an awful educator, an irresponsible mathematician, and an unapologetic narcissist.\r\nHe asks questions in class, which is always a pain. Right before calling on you, he might say something demoralizing like \"I don't think you have the right answer, but go ahead and try.\" After you answer, he may say something like \"I knew you had it wrong.\" or \"Google will never hire you.\"\r\n\r\nKruskal assigns a ton of homework. Be prepared to join a study group and meet multiple times a week and have no social life just to complete his homeworks - which, by the way are really vague sometimes. God forbid you ask him to be more specific with what he means on a question - he will say something like \"it should be clear from the context what I mean\". If you press him further, he will get even more annoyed at you, and never answer your question. The homeworks are vague enough so that a TA in office hours once had to announce to everyone that he instructed people incorrectly on a problem because of misinterpreting what kruskal called \"clear from context.\"\r\nA true mathematician is always very clear and specific when defining a problem that they're solving (or asking someone to solve) - it's arguably the most important part in solving a problem. Yet kruskal can't be bothered to specify what he means when his wording could mean two things reasonably and even a TA gets it wrong.\r\nIf you ever misinterpret kruskal's meaning from context, he will say you're cheating for not \"answering in the spirit of the question\". He thinks you purposefully misinterpreted the question to make it easier, or something.\r\nDon't expect to be able to make regrade requests on much, either. He said something along the lines of \"don't make a regrade request just because a TA graded you more harshly than someone else. That's just life\". even though that is literally what capricious grading means and there are numerous policies against that and the instructional staff have an obligation to correct any capricious grading like that...\r\n\r\nOne time, he was working on a really hard problem in class. A student pointed out an error he made, and he said \"oh. i'm lost and confused. so you are all dismissed\"\r\nAnd we just left without the answer, never getting the answer. Kruskal spends all his time spouting nonsense about how students are always wrong yet he can't solve a problem he posed to us himself.\r\n\r\nIf at all possible, take 351 with someone else who isn't a d0uchebag who likes making his students suffer.","538":"Kruskal is genius but he lacks the ability to teach. He thinks we already know everything. I was in the TA room everyday to get my homework done and study for the exams. Phong saved our lives. Without Phong passing this class would have been impossible. He changed the structure of the class to help students. various office hours to get help. 5 starts for Phong.","539":"Entertaining, very good lecturer. Provides a reasonable amount of work that is easily doable and leniently graded. Take his class for CMSC351 & CMSC474.","540":"Golub talks a lot during lecture without having a lot of information on the slides themselves. The most crucial information you will learn is what he writes down during class. However, he will not post those notes online, so you can't miss any classes. If you show up to class and take down his notes, you will most likely be successful. Every once in a while, he will post example solutions on the course website - take advantage of them because he will most likely ask a similar question on his midterms. He has many homework and practice questions, but never posts the answers. So make sure that you compare answers with other people before the midterms. Study groups are key since you will never be provided with homework answers. If you go over every practice question and every homework, you will be adequately prepared for the midterms. The midterms are simple compared to the practice questions - just make sure you read the instructions carefully because Golub often asks that you only set up the question and not solve it. He isn't the greatest lecturer, but he will teach you enough to succeed in your class.","541":"One of the better professors I've had at UMD CS.  He knows his stuff and is easy to understand and follow.","542":"Coming into this class, I knew what to expect with Kruskal because I had him for CMSC250. He seems like a great guy and he really knows what he is teaching, but I do not find him to be a good teacher. However, I can see why others would disagree. His lecture style seems to work very well for some and not at all for others. I definitely fall into the second category. \r\n\r\nAlthough I stopped attending his lectures early on, I was able to do well in the class by taking the homework assignments seriously, watching a lot of YouTube videos, and watching the Panopto recordings from the other professor. I don't mind learning this way and Kruskal's exams are very fair (even if they are hard) because they are based almost solely on the homeworks. But if you are someone who prefers to learn directly from the lectures instead of someone who learns by struggling through homeworks, I would not recommend taking Kruskal.","543":"He's a pretty good lecturer, explains concepts fairly clearly. His lecture style is writing out math with a pen on a document camera, so sometimes it gets messy with corrections\/multiple pages. That being said, he does make a bunch of mistakes during class that take a while for him to catch, but overall he's good.","544":"Mohammad is a solid lecturer. He co-taught with Kruskal (same homeworks, tests, everything), so if you're looking to escape Kruskal, taking Mohammad won't help. He's a very nice guy and usually explains the material clearly and is well prepared. I also felt like he improved his lecturing over the course of the semester (this was his first semester at UMD). The course is terribly managed and run, but that's the fault of the TAs and Kruskal. If you go to lectures and put time and effort into fully understanding the homeworks and study for the exams, you should be OK on the exams. ","545":"God TA. He held weekly review sessions and was actually f'ing helpful. If it weren't for him, I would've fallen prey to Kruskal's grasp.","546":"Class is a mess, but thats 351 for ya. Teli is a good lecturer though and seems to car about his students.","547":"Terrible teacher, please avoid him. the courses are mess and exam are ridiculous. midterms are easy but final exam isn't the same level as the midterm.","548":"Just keeps on rambling. Always assumes you'll know the concepts and skips over a lot of stuff.","549":"kruskal may be really tough and all, and sometimes doesn't completely finish the math when he does it on the board, but his tests are more or less an easier version of the homework. if you understand how to do the homeworks, you can get a decent grade on his tests. i'm not an extraordinary smart person but i didn't think this class was impossible, but again don't underestimate the class either, because some of the homework questions he asks can seem really difficult at times.  ","550":"Spring 19' was the first semester Teli didn't just use all of Kruskal's materials. The lectures were straightforward and the exams were fair and manageable. ","551":"Great lecturer, with in general, fair exams. He doesn't award much if any partial credit, so it is important to be 100% confident in your answers. I thought that the course's logistics were not the best, even if they were done by the TAs and not Kruskal himself. We weren't able to get our homeworks back before the final for example, and the final took ~1 week to grade. The final was particularly brutal, with ~45% average, but the other tests averaged about 61%. The other exams felt very fair, and if you could do the homework, it shouldn't be bad. The final was not fair however, so you're always taking a risk on whether you're getting a reasonable exam or not.","552":"Great, engaging lecturer who put an emphasis on applying the algorithms. Also covered some algorithms not in Kruskal's. Funny guy who is easy to talk to.\r\n\r\nCurved about 8-10%","553":"Energetic and caring professor, but very sloppy. If you're after rigor, don't take Teli. He spends far more time in lecture reviewing algebra than teaching computer science, and when he does get around to explaining some theory, he mostly just waves his hands.\r\n\r\nThat being said, he is likely an easy A. Take that as you will.","554":"Sometimes he's a good lecturer, and sometimes he just rambles on and on about irrelevant content. Usually he is fairly entertaining when he does that.\r\n\r\nA counterpoint to some of the Kruskal yay-sayers is that when you get to the gritty, Kruskal actually is a good lecturer. I honestly disagree, as Kruskal explained several key points terribly throughout the course, including but not limited to the tree method, several explanations about the existence of paths and the correctness of the MST algorithms, and solving optimization problems using decision problems using polynomial overhead (which is something that he stated will be on the final).\r\n\r\nHe is an average lecturer at best. The homeworks are decently challenging, but they don't help you learn the theory whatsoever. And honestly the theory for this course is extremely meager. To study for the final I made a topics list and it didn't even cover a full page of content.","555":"ok as a lecturer, but i give this rating for the TA's and how he ran the class. Ridiculous and unforgiving grading for a class that has simple material. 48 was a C- this semester. ","556":"Teli isn't a perfect professor, but he genuinely cares about the content he is teaching and about student success. I found his lectures a little boring, but tests and homework felt fair. ","557":"The content and class is a mess tbh. But you can tell that Teli cares and wants to make sure that every student gets the idea down. He uses most of lecture time going over the algebra of some analyses, which makes it easy for students to get lost during lecture and find it a pain to sit back down to review everything for the homeworks. \r\n\r\nBefore the final, I was sitting around a 56%. After getting a 67% on the final (wasn't as bad as anticipated), I managed to get up to 60%, for a final grade of C+ (3% away from a B-!!) Moral of the story, if I can do it, you can too.","558":"If you have class with Kruskal all I can say is GG","559":"The disorganization complaint echoed across this website about 351 stems from a lack of communication between Kruskal and his TA's. There has been a few times where I would get marked off by TA's on homeworks because I did it differently than the grading criteria although I checked in with Kruskal beforehand and made sure my way was correct as well. Although the TA's regraded them, it shows the lack of communication. Also, posts on Piazza regarding how certain problems can be done are usually answered by the TA's with \"defer to Kruskal\". Like, bro, just make up your mind as a teaching panel and tell us, I don't need another side quest to find Kruskal and ask him the same question right now. \r\n\r\nKruskal himself is a very knowledgable professor (dude has been doing research on this area for god knows how long, he's like a fossil). Some lectures he articulates the concepts very clearly and makes it very easy to understand, other lectures he leaves the class a little confused. When the latter happens, please go to office hours before complaining here. From what he told me, he only gets a few visitors per day (TA's might get more). I don't really understand how people can be blasting Kruskal for being a bad professor while they don't go to office hours for help. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately we can't rate courses, we can only rate professors, and Kruskal is one of the better professors in one of the worst-run courses.","560":"Teli loves to focus on the intuition of algorithms and problem solving. Teli is a patient lecturer and often stops to ask if anyone has questions, and he's quite approachable in office hours. In lectures, he works through the book proofs, and in general the exams don't have too much to do with the homeworks. If you are a math wizard then you might get a little bored, in which case I would suggest Kruskal's class. If you just want to get by, Teli's emphasis on intuition will serve you well.","561":"The class really sucks. I really hated it. It\u2019s so focused on trivial algorithms and finding the EXACT runtime complexity that it\u2019s just a math class.\r\n You don\u2019t really have to worry much about algorithm design, just go on leetcode and see how basic divide and conquer\/graph problems are solved and you\u2019ll be able to slide by. Pay close attention to solving recurrences, construction induction, etc. because they\u2019re pretty easy points on exams. \r\nIn my opinion, the hardest part of the tests are trying to understand what the questions are asking, and sometimes the answers to some problems seem nearly impossible to get in the allotted time. Luckily, everyone goes through this struggle together so the final curve is humongous.\r\nThankfully, Teli is a really good professor. He is so thorough and clear in his lectures, he answers everyones questions, and he really cares about your learning. He will skim over things sometimes, but chances are someone will raise their hand and ask for clarity, to which he\u2019ll happily respond to.\r\nOne importing thing though is that he records his lectures BUT not the lectures before tests, which are basically him going through any practice exam he gave us (which are hardly ever representative of an exam we\u2019re given).\r\n\r\nTLDR: Teli good, 351 bad.","562":"Professor Kruskal tries his best to teach the material, and he seems like a nice guy. He has his good moments, and it's in those moments where you can obtain a lot of knowledge about algorithms. However, there are also moments where he rambles a lot, which makes it hard to pay attention to the class. Make sure you try your hardest to understand the course material because it seems fascinating even in a hard class like CMSC 351.","563":"He handled the switch to online classes very well and ended up using a fair grading system to adjust to the difficulties of the semester. He goes pretty fast through the material, so I always benefited more from the Panopto recording more than attending his live lecture. Besides for that, there was the usual 351 nonsense: some homework questions were nearly impossible to solve and you couldn't succeed unless you did extra studying on your own time by using outside resources such as Leetcode.","564":"please don't give last year record, really can't hear anything clear about it.","565":"Teli gives good lectures (especially online where chat makes it easier to ask questions), but his exams are so brutal and completely different from the homework. And the practice exams. Yeah, the practice exams in this class are worthless. This is a class that needs some major changes, but in its current state, I suppose Teli is a good option.","566":"Ok, so I know that Kruskal gets a lot of hate. His course is definitely disorganized and he does not spend lecture time actually teaching the stuff, rather going over other topics like probability and induction, and getting distracted by telling bad jokes. Homeworks were vague and were graded very late. Some TAs were great, but others were not really knowledgable. \r\n\r\nHOWEVER, I will say him and TAs are responsive on Piazza and gave reasonable extensions. Also, the biggest selling point is that his exam questions are almost always variations of the homeworks, which means you can predict what the exam questions may be like in advance. That is the single reason in my opinion why you'd want to take Kruskal over Teli, because his exams, the biggest part of the grade, are predictable enough to pass the class. ","567":"I think Kruskal only half deserves the reputation he has (or that he and 351 jointly have). \r\n\r\nHis lectures are not great. He often implicitly make assumptions in lectures, leaving you very confused if you don't see the implicit assumption yourself, because he will not clarify it unless asked. And even when asked he doesn't answer very well. I truly don't think he's being malicious, he just can't see student's train of thought and see where the reasoning is breaking down.\r\n\r\nPeople who are reasonably \"smart\" (for some definition of intelligence) will probably see these assumptions and be fine in lectures, but people who are not will struggle with this.\r\n\r\nI found the exams to be very fair. It might have been because of covid, but our exams did not include a challenge (or \"interview\") question. Instead they were mostly minor variations on homeworks.\r\n\r\nOverall, I agree with the vocal majority that the course content is not taught well, but disagree that the exams are unfair.","568":" If you don't want to fail, then run! No matter how much effort you put in the class is so poorly taught that you end up not learning anything. ","569":"Had him last year, this review is not just for him but also for his TAs. Had a classmate who tried to get help on HW from a TA named Anton who barely helped and had a very condescending attitude, and at times it felt like all of the TAs were like that. Teli's lectures were simply writing math and proofs over white paper, and they were very dry and sometimes hard to read his handwriting. I wish there could have been additional material like slides. Even if you paid attention it seemed hard to figure detail was actually important and what was not. \r\n\r\nExams are difficult, and homeworks\/practice exams don't really help. What's worse is they are unwilling to provide you with any previous exams whatsoever because they claim it will give the answers away when in reality they could come up with new problems but are too lazy too. Exams felt more like an IQ test where you have to be really clever, and the grading is ruthless. He is extremely stubborn with his rubrics as well; even if both students and TAs feel you have a good argument for partial credit, he's still not gonna give you any points. If I could go back in time I would have taken Kruskal instead because at least his exams are based on his homeworks, unlike Teli and also he seems to be a more effective lecturer who gets his points across and separating them from the non-important points. Only pro I can say is he is nice, but don't make the same mistake I did and think that that means he is an effective teacher.","570":"Took him during a pandemic because no other professors were available don't make the same mistake. he uploads pre-recorded lectures from previous years with horrible sound quality and the final was 45% of our grade. ","571":"Kruskal is a great person, and he's a really brilliant computer scientist. In terms of explaining material, he's pretty good as well. This semester he uploaded short video lecture videos asynchronously, which are great because they let you rewind whenever you want. His homeworks are like puzzles, but if you can talk them out with your friends you'll do a great job on them. MAKE SURE you find people to work on the homeworks with you! Otherwise, it's 10x harder to pass the class. \r\n\r\nNow for the negative about this class: The exams are fucking bullshit. Yeah, they are heavily based on the homeworks, however, the graders show no mercy on some questions. The format of the questions are in a way such that if you are blanking out on a how to solve the problem, you're pretty much screwed out of 5-10 percent of your final grade in the class. I studied and restudied for the final exam so much, but when it came around, I still met some problems where I understood the concept, but the algorithm for solving it, wasn't coming into my head. Personally, I don't know what more I could have done to prepare for the final, and I still got a pretty low score (I passed though). \r\n\r\nSo in summary, clyde is a good professor who gives crazy ass exams. The exams are about 70 percent of your final grade, so make sure you know your shit thoroughly. But at the same time, make sure you are also very well rested before you take the final, or midterm. You want your mind to be on it's A game. \r\n\r\nThe material of this class isn't really too hard to grasp and understand either. I thought that it was going to be based off 250, which I wasn't the best at, but it's a lot easier in my opinion. Just watch out for the exam questions!","572":"Had him last semester. Everyone complains because they don't put in the work. I was busy with recruiting last semester so I prioritized that over school. But if you honestly keep up with the work and don't push all the studying until last minute you'll be fine. Everyone complains that the professor is ass but its because the concepts require actually thinking, whereas everyone is used to spoon feeding.\r\n\r\nRegarding the TAs, its either a hit or a miss. They tend to grade relatively slowly.","573":"One of the sweetest professors I've ever had. He will go through any step of an algorithm or analysis if a student is confused, no matter how trivial it is. This is especially helpful when covering topics that require a deeper conceptual understanding like analyzing the complexity of different variations of quicksort. The homeworks are good practice and if you can get your hands on any of the past exam questions, I highly recommend practicing with those as well. The exams can be difficult, but as long as you make sure you get all the easy points scattered throughout and dont get hung up on any one question, you're golden. There was also a heavy curve at the end of the class and Teli even extended the lower bound of the standard deviation to allow more students to get C's and pass (Math: final mean was 70.82 and std. dev was 11.78 so realistically, only grades above a 59.04 should have passed. But he extended it to allow students above a 54 to pass). All in all an incredible teacher and great guy!","574":"Genuinely nice guy and very knowledgable about the material. However, the exams are complete garbage and have nothing to do with anything he teaches or the homework. Alot of the times it feels like he's not even teaching us anything useful. ","575":"Class is definitely disorganized and needs a major restructuring. Despite this, I think when Kruskal is actually focused on lecturing, he explains things pretty well (like in his 15-20 minute recordings on specific topics). Exams were very difficult and worth way too much, but were modelled very closely to homeworks. TAs are hit or miss. \r\nYou're likely gonna heavily rely on the 351 Bible (a large set of notes by a former TA that covers nearly every topic), along with some online videos for topics that you are confused about. If you do use these, though, you should be able to pass the class. ","576":"This review is based off of the fact that the course is being unfairly graded. The class average is noticeably higher than the past. I have heard from multiple mutual friends that they know other students in large cheating circles, and its likely the cause of the jump in the average. Instructors seem to be unaware of or ignoring this issue, and it is hurting the chances of honest students to pass. Previous semesters had cutoffs in the 40s and 50s, but current students are facing a 64% cutoff. \r\n\r\nThis issue could be dealt with by grading this semester slightly different than normal and accounting for grade inflation with a lower cutoff, but it does not seem like they are going to. It is understandable that cheating is difficult to enforce online, but it should not lead to negative repercussions on students performing average under honest efforts. While the semester is not over, it seems like this issue is not going to change. \r\n\r\nI understand some people may read this review and assume I am just taking out my frustration, but I am not. This is a serious problem. I like Teli as a person, and he has better lecturing skills than other professors. This issue stems from the inability to properly proctor exams through Zoom. Adapting your class properly in times like these is important, and Teli just is not. I hope he proves me wrong, but as I said before, the way he is seemingly ignoring this issue is disappointing.\r\n\r\n","577":"I'm honestly not sure how Nathan became a TA. He is a horrible TA who does not care about his students.\r\n\r\nI had to submit regrade assignments every time he graded my HW. He ignores half of them and I've always had to bring them up with other TA's. His explanations are vague and unclear. It seems like he's just trying to cover up the fact that he does not understand the material. He eats rice and soy sauce during office hours (?).\r\n\r\nKusal is a much better TA. I can't believe Kusal isn't the head TA.","578":"Justin was fantastic. He clearly cared about us and wanted us to learn the material without truly worrying about grades. His exams were super fair based on what he taught us in class. The homework was tricky but he designed them so that we would learn the material and think about it in an abstract manner.","579":"By far one of the best professors I've met at UMD. I was skeptical about joining his class as it was his first time teaching CMSC351 but he went above and beyond during the semester we were learning online. Justin spent a lot of time coming up with online class notes on his own time to explain difficult concepts, and spent a lot of time in lecture going through examples to help clarify content in the notes. Grading and exam timing-wise, Justin was very empathetic and reasonable with students.  Do the homework and review his notes before exams and you'll do well in the course!","580":"Made arguably the hardest CS class at UMD into one of the most interesting, useful, and honestly kind of easy class there is. Has such detailed notes for each topic that is publicly available (look up immortal umd for his umd website with the links to notes). These were absolute lifesavers and also just demonstrated how much he enjoys what he does, which is another reason why I gave him 5 stars. He is definitely one of the best professors I have ever seen. He is nice in office hours and with questions, but he will come across extremely blunt and sometimes rude in piaza and emails, but he explains that it's the fact he has so many questions and has to go through them. So I was taken aback at first since he seemed a little rude in emails and posts but he is really nice in office hours and just when he is able to actually spend time on answers. ","581":"Teli's work was relatively hard to follow online, but he was more than happy to answer any questions people had, and genuinely wanted people to understand the topics.  Homeworks are almost copies of lecture work with numbers changed and occasionally new problems, but exams were almost entirely new problems somewhat based on lectures, and unrelated to practice exams.","582":"I took this class in Fall 2020\r\nPros:\r\n+ The professor is very smart, he definitely knows what he's talking about.\r\n+ The inclusion of quick quizzes is a fast way for you to know if you're caught up on all the content\r\nCons:\r\n- Lecture content is posted in the form of asynchronous videos. The video length is often significantly longer than what a lecture would be, so it forces a significant out-of-class time investment\r\n- The live lectures were almost completely useless, he spent two months going over basic induction and never covered actual relevant material\r\n- Tests are quite hard ","583":"Some of his videos were really good, but there were a lot of lecture videos that had horrible audio or loads of content that did not matter. The class administration is so horribly run I would title this class the worst run class at UMD. Homeworks never graded on time (many graded AFTER the exams that the homework material was on), quizzes randomly showing up (like at 9:00 pm due at 10:00 am, thank god that was fixed), and many more. If these administration problems were fixed this class honestly wouldn't be that terrible. Probably like a 4-star, but those issues are so colossal I can't rate higher.","584":"I've heard all sorts of scary things about Kruskal so I was pretty nervous going into 351, but he's actually really nice. I thought he was a good lecturer, much more interesting than most CS profs at UMD. I don't know how he does things in person but for the online version the actual lecture material was prerecorded and class time was for him to go over various assignments or just talk about some random topic, usually something 250-related. Overall pretty interesting, he likes to tell jokes and stories or just kind of ramble.\r\nI think the main issue with the class is that it's pretty disorganized. Kruskal seems to have outsourced all the course logistics to TAs, with mixed results. Personally I didn't mind this but I can definitely see how it bothers people, so be warned.","585":"Avoid this man at all costs. If I could go lower than 1 star I would. Don't listen to any of the reviews for this man that are above 3 stars. All of his lectures are pre-recorded from either a packed lecture hall where all you can hear is the students' coughing, or from his bedroom at 240p quality with tin-can audio that only plays in one ear. His \"class times\" were just 1 to 1.5 hours of him doing problems that are irrelevant to the lecture or homework material. The homework material was always based on an advanced version of lecture material that you did not learn how to do. The two exams (for my semester) were a grand total of 80% of the final grade, were 6 questions, and consisted of problems 5 levels above what you learn from class material and that I'm pretty sure he cooked up in his evil layer with the specific purpose of making you cry. Our midterm average as a class was a 44. The final exam average as a class was never released, but the entire class' grades were so bad that they lowered the final C range to a 41 in the class. The previous semester had their 'C' range lowered to a 50, which is apparently the normal passing range for his classes. Alongside all of this, Kruskal does not answer emails or his phone. He hardly ever responds to the TA's, but every single bit of communication to you comes through the TA's including his \"office hours\" which is actually just \"TA hours.\" To top it all off at the end of the semester, Kruskal posted incorrect letter grades to everyone's transcripts based on our unweighted number grades. More than half the class had 'D' or 'F' posted to their transcripts when they had actually passed with a 'C' or higher. It has been over one month since the class has ended and the Chair of Computer Science as well as the Dean of Computer Science have just admitted that they can't fix students' grades because Kruskal will not answer his phone or emails to confirm with anyone from the school that he messed up. Because of this, many students from the class got deregistered from their next semester's classes because they currently (and incorrectly) do not meet pre-requisite requirements.\r\n\r\nSummary of this review: Kruskal does not care about the students. He is a tenured professor that is forced to show up and provide \"something\" to his students. He does not care if anyone learns the material, he will not communicate with you, and he seems to enjoy causing immense stress. This class material is already extremely difficult for even for the smartest Algorithm students, yet Kruskal manages to make it exponentially more difficult and stressful. Avoid this man and anything he teaches at all costs for as long as you live. Go to another school to fill this requirement if you have to. It is not worth it to fight through torture with him.","586":"I cannot imagine any other professor has ever taught CMSC351 at the same high level quality as Justin. As someone who took the course with Clyde Kruskal and failed, retaking it with Justin was the biggest blessing in my computer science degree. His notes for this course are so good that I plan on using them for interview preparation and beyond. He made the class exciting, interesting, and erased the dread about algorithms which was instilled in me by Kruskal.","587":"So you've made it to CMSC351. Congrats! Here's the deal: this course is difficult no matter which professor you take. Teli is a decent teacher and will happily answer questions in his OH or in class but the reason I believe this class is difficult is because of how few resources students are given to prepare for the 2 midterms and 1 final that collectively make up 83.5% of your final grade (yeah, you read that right). The homeworks are really good for helping you understand each topic at a very deep level but aren't good exam prep because the exams don't require you to understand the topics as thoroughly. \r\n\r\nTeli gives out practice exams that don't contain any relevant problems to the topics of the exam. They are completely useless. Students are forced to go into each exam without the slightest idea of how to prepare or what could be on it. We were given a list of topics for each exam but the list was so large it was practically impossible to study all the possible topics. ","588":"Kruskal is honestly not a bad professor, but the problem is he's not really organized. When he comes to class prepared, his lectures are really good, otherwise he just spends time talking about other concepts which can be cool, but they don't really matter too much. My biggest problem is the TAs. It honestly seemed like they were working against us, trying to look for any reason to take as many points off as possible. Kruskal is way more understanding than them, and he's actually easier to talk to. I just wish he would do a bit more, like making the grading rubric for exams instead of letting the TAs do it.","589":"Rambling. Terrible recordings. Doesn't interact \/want to with students. ","590":"Teli is a nice and approachable professor. 351 is a pretty difficult class no matter who the professor is, but I thought Teli did a good job explaining concepts. The homeworks were appropriately difficult, although there were a few questions that required a lot of time to work through and understand. One thing I thought was really good was that he lets you work with other students as long as you cite their name. However, the exams are not remotely related to the actual class content. I took this class in Spring 2020 and I felt like the professor just took random leetcode problems off the internet and combined it with unecessarily complicated mathematical problems. There is a pretty fat curve on the class though (at least 10 points from what I remember) which is nice. My main issue with the class, which is partially just the fault of the way UMD has structured the 351 curriculum, is that it is not actually a useful algorithms class. A really huge focus of the class is calculating the exact runtimes of different algorithms, rather than actually focusing on how the algorithms actually work. Unfortunately its still a mandatory CS course, but if you want to actually learn algorithms, take CMSC451. I gave Teli 4 stars because he did his best given the circumstances, but CMSC351 barely deserves 1 star.","591":"Ave =61%, STD=17%, fail cutoff = 49%, what do you mean that equals 1\/4 of the class fails.\r\nOther than the extreme cut-off, and how low the exam aves are. Horrible prof, lectures are half tangents that don't relate to cs or anything academic. Explains things poorly. Class is unorganized, our syllabus was finalized day grades are due. He leaves almost everything outside of lect to TAs.He writes his exams the morning of. Half our assignments got graded the day after grades are due. The list goes on ","592":"Very interesting professor in my opinion. He started prerecording lectures for recent semesters which seems to be better in my opinion. He said that he will redo the ones with poor audio quality for future semesters. Basically, all of the actual content is covered in these videos. Class time is for going over homeworks, quizzes, exams, etc, and tangents about interesting puzzles. \r\n\r\nI highly recommend going to class because I think it helps you practice how to find solutions. \r\n\r\nThe quizzes were often dumb gotchas, but there is one every class, they total like 6% of your grade, and a significant portion of them (maybe around 5) are dropped. \r\n\r\nExams are pretty gnarly. Average is usually between 50% and 60%. \r\n\r\nWe had way too few TAs. We had about 10 out of 17 homeworks ungraded on the day of the final exam, which is unacceptable. \r\n\r\nKruskal is pretty helpful in office hours and is much more generous with partial credit than the TAs. ","593":"- He pre-records pretty much all of his lectures. Sometimes the lectures are clear and well-made, but mostly he uses in-class recordings from a couple of years ago, which can be frustrating to watch because of poor audio. The actual content of his lectures are OK though, and I'd say he's overall a decent lecturer. \r\n- The class sessions are used to go over assignments and any extra ramblings. This flipped classroom approach seems nice at first, but the problem is that he assigns a quiz that is due before every class, so you pretty much have to dedicate an hour or two before the class to actually watch the lecture and take the quiz, in addition to the time that you're already spending on homework assignments and studying. \r\n- Exams are crap. Averages are usually in the mid 50s, and make up around 80-85% of your grade (the rest of your grade comes from homework\/pre-class quizzes). The fortunate side of this is that Kruskal grades with a huge curve, so you're usually not at risk of outright failing if you're doing about average. In the past, exams used to be based heavily on homeworks, but that seems to have changed this semester, with exams having new problems that are only loosely based on previous homeworks. He also seems to have added a number of different topics this semester that he doesn't usually cover, and this was particularly frustrating because many of the TAs and GSS leaders did not have any familiarity with the material at the tail-end of the semester. \r\n- He outsources pretty much all of his course operations to his TAs, aside from lectures and homework\/exam writing. This was probably one of the most frustrating parts of the course, because the TA team is woefully understaffed and left most of our homeworks ungraded until after finals week. I do not understand how 330 had almost 20 TAs and 351 has barely 10, most of whom are other undergrads who have obligations with their own courses. Seriously, this is one of the most ridiculous parts of this class - please hire more TAs. \r\n- Kruskal himself is a nice guy and is flexible + willing to help. I would highly encourage people to go to the actual classes\/lectures to stay engaged and to get help from him directly. \r\n\r\nTl;dr - Kruskal is a nice guy and a decent lecturer overall. This class is highly disorganized, has difficult exams, far too few TAs, and content that is pretty boring and occasionally difficult to understand. If you can take this course with Justin or Teli, take it with them. ","594":"Kruskal's okay I guess. He's a pretty cool guy to talk to, but the class was disorganized, the TAs were kinda ruthless, and the exams were crazy. \r\n\r\nIf you're gonna take 351, just take Teli if you can. \r\n\r\nIf you have to take Kruskal, try to keep your grade above 50%. If your grade dips below that you're almost guaranteed to fail.","595":"Some general thoughts:\r\nVery, very prepared for lecture. \r\nGood lecturer, but covered unnecessary content at times. Sometimes he would spend a lot of time covering material that was never on an exam or homework.  \r\nHomework was usually manageable, but occasionally ridiculous to the point where even the TAs didn't know how to do it (Dr. Teli didn't always provide the TAs with solutions in a timely manner).\r\nReally nice guy.\r\nSurprisingly generous curve. \r\nPainful weighting (each weekly homework 1.5%, each exam 25%, and final exam is whatever remains... yeah it's a lot of weight on the exams).\r\nGrading done by TAs (I think exclusively) so a lot of subjectivity. Some TAs were more forgiving with partial credit than others. Just a little frustrating.\r\nHe's an absolute genius, which sometimes makes it difficult to grasp a topic from his explanations, but he (as other reviews mention) is really really good at answering questions until there's a solid understanding (both in lecture and office hours).\r\nExams were frustrating because they use the same practice exams every semester and the practice rarely helps with the actual exam. It's kinda a matter of if you were lucky enough to study the right things at the right level of detail (it's not really possible to study everything at the highest level because he brushes over some of the really hard stuff). I'm normally good at studying \"smart, not hard\" but the exams in 351 really threw me for a loop. Thankfully he provides topic lists for each exam that help narrow it down a bit.\r\n\r\nOverall, I would say Dr. Teli could be a perfect professor if he ran the class slightly differently (which would really just mean making it a bit easier, providing hw solutions earlier on to the TAs, only covering relevant material, and giving more useful practice for exams).","596":"I honestly don't understand all the hate Kruskal gets. I thought his lectures were usually pretty easy to follow and he is willing to clarify any confusion during class. The homework can sometimes be frustrating but he allows us to work in groups which I would highly recommend doing. He is also a nice professor to talk to after class or during office hours. The thing I feel drags down his overall perception is his exams. The exams expect that you will be able to come up with efficient algorithms that are different than ones seen on the homework which makes them difficult to study for. You can't just memorize and regurgitate information from class and expect to do well, but if that was the case, I think it could defeat the whole point of the class. \r\n\r\nOverall his class is pretty difficult but it's definitely possible to get a good grade and I believe the content is worthwhile learning. ","597":"Good professor, class is pretty manageable if you go to OH religiously until you solve the HWs and understand them.\r\n\r\nHaving some level of leetcode prep will help immensely as a lot of common problems are used in the class. \r\nI took the coding interview class at the same time and there were times when the HWs had the same problem. ","598":"Great professor as ratings suggest. I had a few cons to how 351 was managed.\r\n\r\n1. No recorded lectures. \r\n2. Never can get an extension on homeworks (no exceptions). \r\n\r\n\r\nOther than that, amazing. ","599":"Best professor at UMD. If you are going to take 250 or 351, do it with Justin","600":"best 351 professor ever. Exams are super fair and he is amazing at explaining. ","601":"Coming off of 250 with Justin, I was expecting to get torn to shreds with 351, especially with the stigma around the class. Given that I don't think Justin is the best at organizing courses, I think he and Erika had a great duo with her taking most of the nitty-gritty details like Piazza answering and course announcements. The class ran extremely well (definitely some improvements needed on the TAs and their grading in this course, but that's not on Justin) and I can still vouch for Justin's lecturing. Guy is one of the best at UMD, he could explain Dijkstra's to a 5-year-old. Tests and homework were extremely fair, an issue I found sometimes with the 250 homework, and both Erika and Justin made the course extremely enjoyable.\r\n\r\nI also had him for 241 this semester. Relatively smaller course, pumped out grading and got the concepts where they needed to be. Could definitely tell he was in his comfort zone with this course as his lectures were spot on every time. Tests were extremely fair and grading was good. Overall, 10\/10 professor.","602":"Lectures were great of course. It's Justin. However, the course could've been managed better, and rubrics for homework's and exam solutions could have been much less ambiguous, as well as the questions on the exam. \r\n\r\nThere can be a time where you work with your friend on a homework, then you receive a 0\/15 on a homework problem while your friend receives a 15\/15 because the rubric is not as definitive and TA's judge based off their intuition and subjectivity. Same goes for exam problems, besides the fact that you obviously do the exam independently, you can have a solution that follows the gradescope rubric to earn a specific amount of points, but the TA can be subjective and not go off of what the rubric says and even give you a 0 for the problem for what should have been partial credit atleast. This may be a TA problem sure, but Justin leads the TAs and instructs them on what to do, so I feel there's a bit on him too as he could make the rubrics for homework problems and exams more definitive so TAs can't be as subjective. Exam problems were ambiguous as well to an extent, mainly the true\/false portion, but some written responses as well, but the true\/false was only a few points (typically 10 points an exam). Essentially, there could be multiple interpretations of a question which could make you believe either true or false based on the interpretation you go with.\r\n\r\nOverall, great professor along with his lectures of course. No doubt about that. He needs to be more straight forward about a few things though. The course wasn't difficult to manage so he did amazing with that, but there would be confusion on the ambiguity from the student and TA side, in terms of grading and interpreting problems.","603":"The actual GOAT. Really made sure we understood the concepts he was teaching. He and Erika cotaught this semester, and they did a fantastic job of making 351 a much better experience than I was anticipating. Would recommend!! ","604":"Really great lectures, he's very caring and truly worries about his students and if you come up to him with questions he will be very nice when explaining and explains topics in a very straightforward and easy to understand way.\r\n\r\nHowever as great as he is, I had a very stressful time in 351 because of the grading issues that came with basically every assignment. TA's most of the time if you had something not resembling the rubric in a homework assignment, or just because based on their own judgement, will not take their time to read your answer and will not hesitate to slash off as many points as you can as possible (Many times I have gotten back as much as 20%-25% of my assignment just because the TA did not read my answer entirely, and I've had to explain very thoroughly in my regrades). \r\n\r\nI know this is not his fault, but he was very aware of the grading issue because we would get multiple announcements about how there would be over 100s of regrade requests for each assignment and exams. This would not be an issue if the grading was more careful in seeing if the student truly understands the topic instead of how close it is to the rubric, or even something as small if simplifying 1 more step would give the same answer. Oh and what the other reviewer below said is absolutely correct, sometimes I would compare homework answers after grades came out on grade scope, and classmates who wrote the exact same I did would get full credit while I would get -50% off or even the entire question wrong. Same thing if they had the same reasoning for more deep thought questions.  Mind you sometimes you would have to regrade this multiple times to get your points back if the TA's were unwilling to check, and it wasn't for sure that you would get your points back. \r\n\r\nLastly the reason that also made me give him a not so great review even though I enjoyed having him a lot as my instructor, the above issue of getting massive hundreds of regrades because of extremely inconsistent grading, got so bad that during the last weeks of school after the final they said that since regrade request numbers are always hundreds, they would not allow regrade requests for hw12,hw13 and the final exam. Our homework is worth 28% of our grade and people were relying on this to bring up their averages if they didn't drop them, and they even admitted they graded the hw \"leniently\" and the rubric would even say \"anything reasonable even if not correct\". My questions were not read, marked off points without explaining any reason because of the shortness of time with regrades from past assignments, and the final exam also had some grading inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nMy final point, Justin throughout the semester said that the cut-offs would be lowered  slightly below the regular cut offs to account for the grading inconsistencies, the ambiguous writing of questions on exams and etc. This was only 1% or so when confirming when my friends, which if I will be honest, 1% of the entire class is not enough to account to how extremely bad and up to the TA grading your assignments judgement is. And even if Justin offered to contact him regarding grading on hw12,hw13 and the final exam, he would only do this if you were borderline. Which, is kind of extremely hard to figure out when we did not have cutoffs published. ","605":"Justin is the GOAT","606":"This man is simply bad at his job. Grades take forever to get back, the class structure is abysmal, and homework\/lecture material often has little to do with the ruthless exams. I could go on, but the other reviews pretty much accurately put things into perspective.\r\n\"You teach your students? I torture mine.\" -Literally overheard Dr. Kruskal saying this to another faculty member and I don't think I've heard anything more accurate.\r\nHe may be smart, but this man should not be teaching. Avoid at all costs.","607":"I took this class with Kruskal in Fall 2021. He's a pretty chill dude but he doesn't teach at all. Whatever material we had to learn, he just posted recorded lectures on Elms. In class he would sometimes give us problems to do, but other than that he would talk about anything else besides class topics. It was really down to us to learn the material on our own. And of course his exams were the most stressful thing about that semester. If you take Kruskal, form study groups, visit office hours frequently (two things I didn't do...), and start the homework early.","608":"Justin's teaching has probably saved me a big headache while taking this class. Most people have said that this class is one of the hardest classes were required to take for the CS major. But with this professor I actually really understand what is going on. Whether or not my grades reflect it is another issue but thats on my studying. Going to his lectures and not just reading his notes that he posts really helps me understand the concepts and I'm really glad for that.","609":"One of the sole brightspots in UMD STEM undergrad.","610":"Hal is a good professor. He gives very interesting projects for AI based on the Pacman game. These are actually kind of fun to do. \r\nThe HW is a little too easy I'd say, and doesn't necessarily clarify the concepts from class. But at least it doesn't take long.\r\nThe exams are pretty fair and not too hard.\r\nHal's lectures are a bit tough to follow and he isn't the best at explaining concepts, but he will go over good examples and try his best to explain if you are not understanding.\r\nOverall though, Hal is a really cool professor, and he cares about his students.","611":"Perlis has a straight forward lecture style (notes available on course website). Unfortunately, his pace is extremely slow. What could be completed in 30min will take him an hour. This is partly because he is careful to explain all details, which does help with understanding. \r\nThe homeworks are easy and very helpful for reviewing the material. We've only had one project so far (3\/5 through the semester) and it took roughly 1 hour. Quizzes every week based solely on lecture material. Pretty easy if you pay attention in class.\r\nPLEASE NOTE: this is an INTRO class to AI. Most of the semester is spent building the fundamentals and not actually exploring AI techniques. It starts with blind searches, smart searches, propositional and first-order logic. These are not difficult topics, but they take up HALF the course.","612":"I think Professor Nau is a nice person, but not the most effective\/organized teacher. I took the class because I thought AI sounded cool, and it is but I don't think I was ready to put as much effort as I would have needed to get an A.\n\r\nBottom Line: He's not bad, but don't take this class if you're just looking for an easy A. Be prepared to put in a decent amount of work.","613":"Do not take a class with this professor. His class was very unorganised\/unstructured. For the first project he had put it on the forum for about 2 weeks before even making any mention of it. He gave us about 1 month for that project, which was a simple \"get familiar with the language\" sort of a project and for the other 2, which were significantly harder he gave 2 weeks.\r\nHis lectures were pretty boring, and he took forever to give back the homeworks.\r\nHe tried to be helpful, but his teaching style\/class structure just works against him.","614":"Pros:\r\n-Interesting and Challenging material\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n-Professor makes mistakes during in class derivations, at one point becoming so flustered he ended class early. \r\n-Just reads from slides during lecture, students can do this just as easily on their own time and skip class\r\n-Grading was not prompt at all, project 2 of 3 was finally graded just a few days before final\r\n-Homework solutions are not posted, and homework is only returned if you go to TA office hours\r\n-Project 3 was based on TensorFlow, which the professor admitted \"I don't know anything about and won't be able to help you. Just read and work through the tutorials\"\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n-Not easy, you'll have to study a lot, but the material is pretty interesting\r\n-Going to lectures isn't a good use of time\r\n-Projects are all group based and project 3 was absurdly difficult with no guidance","615":"At the time, Josh was a PhD student teaching this class during a Summer semester. He was pretty chill (as was this class) when it came to the material, grading and the exams. We had one midterm which was significantly easier than the homeworks (which already are not so bad) and a final exam which was a little harder but I never felt unprepared for any of it.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't say he is very effective when it comes to conveying the material. I still had gaps in my knowledge that only YouTube and other outside sources could fill. Overall, the class is easy. Josh makes it easy and from day one he told us \"This is probably the easiest 400 level you will take here\", and \"I do not like failing anyone so I try my best not to do so\". If you want to take a 400 level class during the summer, and Josh is teaching it again, consider this class. ","616":"Bless papa Josh. I took Josh during the summer of 2018 and it was super chill. The project were very simple and straightforward. He is very communicative on piazza and in class as well. The homeworks were manageable (could complete them all in one day) He was also very communicative on piazza. (Questions had a very fast response time and he gives straight answers, none of that \"go read the text book on page ___.\" stuff. Overall, i would definitely recommend him.","617":"Josh was a great professor, he's a grad student and still has that drive to inspire others. He was receptive to feedback and is very enthusiastic. The home works were manageable and the exams were more than fair. He had 3 straightforward projects and his reply time on piazza was omniscient. Honestly a great guy and  an awesome professor. I am by no means an honor student, but even I managed to get an A. Meet with him in office hours if you need help he's really great at explaining the material. If you study the home work you'll  definitely succeed on the exams.  Definitely take him if you get the chance. ","618":"I was really concerned with this class reading the previous reviews. He's actually a pretty decent professor if you listen to him. I really kind of wish that they didn't go over as much First Order Logic in the course but other than that he really paid attention to student concerns, was lenient with deadlines and frequently added extensions. If you had a question in class he would stop everything and made sure you understood the material and would readily go over anything anyone asked to.\r\n\r\nThe project was pretty fun actually and I've heard a few people talk about how it was nice to have a project that actually demonstrated AI and was something they could show to their non-CS friends.\r\n\r\nI would recommend taking this class with Dr. Nau!","619":"One of the nicest professors I've ever taken. Taught the material clearly and commonly gives extensions on assignments if enough students ask for it. Reads from slides with heavy information, but goes back through them and students are visibly confused or ask questions.","620":"I took this class in spring 2019 and learned a lot about AI. Perlis' lecture style was a bit hard to follow at first (slowly going through examples handwritten on the projector) but I always understood concepts by the end of class (more than I can say for other professors). Simple quizzes on Mondays to refresh on the material, two midterms were pretty standard (mix of short answer and multiple choice). We had 5 HW and 3 projects, all of which took me about average time to finish. I heard from classmates that they had trouble getting extra help in office hours, but I never had a problem. I liked how responsive Perlis was about posting notes\/answers and responding on Piazza; I would recommend this class as a good mid-difficulty CS upper-level.","621":"This class was terrible. Very unorganized, waited forever for grades and overall sad. I already took 422 and this class was more dry and uninteresting. Thought it would be cool since ya know, AI but it was very difficult to bring myself to class and care about doing the world. ","622":"Uninteresting and poorly communicated projects. Lecture covers the material well but is uninteresting.  Exams are very easy and it is not hard to get a good grade in the course. Homeworks are easy as well.","623":"Nice person, not so great class. This has been the most frustrating class I have taken in my undergrad here. The projects were poorly implemented and communicated, and the TA's did not really help much. It would often be the case that there would be dozens of piazza questions left unanswered on the day before an exam or a project. In addition, expectations on projects and how they would be graded was not communicated well at all. With no semblance of tests to evaluate your performance, you just had to write something and hope whatever arbitrary grading scheme worked in your favor, if not then oh well. For this reason many people ended up with very low scores in the class, despite putting in a lot of effort. \r\nI would be very careful in taking this class. If you are expecting a class with clear expectations on projects and transparency with grading, this is not it. Instead you will feel a lot of stress over unclear grading, lack of communication and poorly defined student expectations. ","624":"Spring 21 - Online -\r\nDoesn't record his lectures, has really vague slides and the exams are fixed for a certain time which makes it really hard if you're not staying in the US.","625":"She's okay, some things are a little confusing and the projects so far are acceptable. Sometimes her accents make things a little hard to understand. However, the slides are nice and clear, you just have to download them before hand and take notes while she teaches. ","626":"Insanely generous professor. We had a dropped homework and PROJECT. Incredible!\r\n\r\nHowever, the lectures are unengaging and I found it faster and more effective just to review lecture slides.","627":"Although he's a nice guy, he's sort of a grandpa if you know what I mean. Doesn't record his lectures, which was annoying. To be fair the class is still easy with only the slides that he posts and a friend or two that does go to lecture (for when a concept is unclear). I would just knock out in class so I completely stopped going after the midterm and still did alright. I personally wouldn't take him again, but only because there are definitely better professors at UMD.","628":"This class and this professor were alright. Kind of unremarkable. CMSC421 isn't as interesting as it sounds, and there's a solid month of the course where you're spending time on stuff that you wouldn't really associate with artificial intelligence. An annoying portion of this course was basically a repeat of information from CMSC250 and STAT400, and neither of those things were very interesting or really what I was thinking of when I took this course. The class does end strong, focusing on neural networks and machine learning and those kinds of interesting things.\r\n\r\nReggia is just a very bland professor, I guess. His slides are a little bare bones, and he doesn't record lectures. So I felt that going to class was more or less necessary. I couldn't learn anything just by reading his slides. If you go to class, you'll get a lot more out of what Reggia is actually saying. His lectures didn't blow me away or anything, but he's solid. The exams and homeworks were kind of tough, but they weren't graded very harshly, so that's fine. There's a group project. That's no fun, but whatever.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I would recommend this class if you're looking for a lower workload class. If you're in the unfortunate position of taking three 400 levels in one semester, as I was this semester, this class isn't a bad choice because the workload is fairly minimal and not particularly challenging. But overall I wouldn't call it a super interesting class, and I don't feel like I got all that much out of it.","629":"The course was well planned. All projects were all public tests so you knew your grade when you turned it in. Lectures at times were unengaging. Recorded all lectures so you didn't have to attend.","630":"I took this class Spring 2021 (online semester). This class is definitely one of the lighter workload 400 levels, and Reggia has major grandpa vibes. It's not necessarily the most engaging course, but you do get to learn a few cool things. The exams were actually pretty difficult given the time contraint, but he has an extremely generous curve (I think a 60 on the midterm counted as an A). I wish he recorded the lectures, but overall Reggia was approachable and cared about the students.","631":"CMSC421 with Reggia is an extremely disappointing class. The first month you spend learning search algorithms (yes, exactly the same ones you already did in CMSC132). Then you spend 1 month on propositional logic (yes, exactly the same stuff you already did in CMSC250). Next, you cover the same bayes rule you already did in STAT400, and the following month and a half is just a watered down version of CMSC422 (and yes, you learn the exact same ML models, absolutely nothing new). You spend the remaining 15% of the course learning niche, obsolete (in both industry and research) topics like programming in LISP and Prolog. Topics that would be an actual extension of anything you've previously learned, like say Reinforcement Learning, are barely touched upon beyond a single lecture.\r\n\r\nBeyond the class being wholly underwhelming, Dr. Reggia is actually an incredibly reasonable professor. We did not have a single lick of programming assigned in the class, had 3 homework assignments and 3 take home quizzes (graded on effort not correctness) which you could easily find answers to on the slides and the midterm and final were both identical to the homeworks, if not easier. The only thing to keep in mind is that there is a semester-long group project worth 30% of your grade that you must complete in groups of 6 that involves writing an academic paper on a topic in AI (not an essay, you actually have to do something new in the field). So if you're a senior looking for an easy, low-effort class take 421 with Reggia, but if you actually want to learn something I suggest you look elsewhere.","632":"Dr. Reggia is an easygoing professor and cares about his class a lot. It's basically a survey class for a wide range of ML and AI techniques. I recommend this class if you don't know anything about AI\/ML. Many of the topics are taught at the surface level, but to teach anything above that would require significantly higher math prereqs which would get in the way of the spirit of the course. If you already have extensive experience in ML this class is probably not for you.","633":"Regli started out seeming like an accomplished and interesting professor, but as the semester went on that facade faded. He is one of the most disrespectful professors I have ever had. The first programming assignment he gave us had 3 conflicting sets of instructions, took the longest of any cs project I've ever taken (for some people ~40+ hours), and was detrimentally open ended, which is something I normally appreciate. His exam questions are extremely vague and have no clear answer. You can know your stuff and still fail the exam because you have no idea what the questions are asking. Overall this has been the least organized and most condescending class I have ever taken. Regli sees himself as above the students and above the class. He has not dealt with the material in 30 year and when pressed on an answer will just try to make you look stupid. Take this class if you have to, it won't be the end of the world, but you will probably hate him and the class.","634":"Professor Regli is a very considerate professor as he has been both lenient with grades and deadlines. His projects can be a little challenging (and the first one was a little too open ended - but by fault of one of the TAs), but they are fair and teach you a lot more about the concepts in AI than just the slides alone. For his exams, while they are a little more on the challenging side, they have generous curves (as an 82% on one exam translated to an A). As far as workload goes, it should be pretty manageable since there are 3 programming assignments and then 3 (much smaller) homework assignments throughout the whole semester. He recommends that you read the textbook and do practice problems, but this is mostly supplementary imo (and probably not worth the extra effort). I disagree with the comment about him being disrespectful as he has always been eager to help and connect with me whenever I've reached out to him during\/after class. My only complaints about Regli are that it can be a little hard to follow along with him during the lectures because he goes over a lot of content in small amount of time, without pausing to do practice problems or repeating the content, which makes it hard to retain the information. Overall, I'd recommend Regli as he does care about the content and you having practical takeaways from CMSC421.","635":"Professor Tokekar is a well-intentioned professor with a strong background in AI and the material within the course is interesting. He also does a good job at creating assignments and projects that are relevant to the concepts we were studying. He also answers questions well within lecture and breaks down the topics for exams and best ways to approach projects\/assignments. The TAs also do a good job at answering questions during online & in-person office hours. However, there are a few things that I think Prof Tokekar could improve upon when it comes to this course: \r\n1) Posting the lecture slides in a more timely manner because sometimes, it takes more than 1 day for the most recent lecture slides to be posted and students that missed lecture may have to wait to catch up\r\n2) Responding to Piazza posts more quickly as it takes a while for students to get answer to those questions\r\n3) Posting more practice problems & exams as although the assignments do a good job at covering the concepts and the lecture slides have good examples, more problems would help us master these concepts easier. Also, we only got 1 sample midterm and having at least 1 more would have helped. \r\n4) Faster grading & regrading because it took almost 4 weeks for midterm results to be released onto ELMS and a few weeks for projects to be graded and is taking a while for grades to be transferred from Gradescope to ELMS\r\n\r\nOther than that, I would say the course was managed well by Professor Tokekar.","636":"Moderately chill dude. Should've failed this class, but my man came through with an epic review sesh.","637":"A very chill dude.","638":"I strongly felt the particular content of this course is best (and easiest) learned through his whiteboard style rather than by book.  Clyde covers a TON of ground in one lecture's time, especially when compared to professors who just read off a watered-down powerpoint from the book for their entire class \"lecture\".  \n\r\nThe big caveat is if you have a lot of trouble following (at least roughly) what he's doing, it won't be much fun for you and you will feel lost all lecture.  Either way you need to write down literally everything he does.  The material can be hard to grasp, but Clyde is really great at walking through an algorithm.  If you take good notes and review them (possibly with another classmate\/TA) you will eventually understand it.\n\r\nThe other most important thing to do in this class is to ask questions when something isn't clear.  In each class there's usually 2-6 little insights he forgets to mention, if you can catch those omissions and get him to explain them, you are a hero and it will be tremendously insightful for you and for every other student in the room.  Although if you still don't get his explanation, you may need to just let it go- and if you took good notes, you should eventually understand it when you are reviewing them later.\n\n","639":"Kruskal is great in this course. His policy on homework is great (hand it in whenever, no real due dates). You just have to make sure to keep yourself on top of it so you don't fall behind. HW is good practice of the concepts.\n\r\nExams are tough, but that's to be expected for this type of course. The questions are fair.\n\r\nMost importantly, Kruskal makes the course very interesting by motivating the topics very well. He is also very good at explaining stuff, but you have to make sure to ASK him questions. Otherwise, he will breeze through the material and you won't understand anything. He is decent for help in office hours too.\n\r\nMy only complaint would be that he seems a little disorganized (just try visiting his office for example). However, he never lost any of my work, so this is not a big issue.","640":"This course was super fun! Easily my favorite course taken at UMD so far. It's a panorama of cool stuff in algorithms- I was continually surprised with intuitive tricks that are simple to explain but probably took months each to develop. They're priceless drips of distilled knowledge that you can't afford to miss if you're a CS major who plans to stop at your bachelor's degree. \n\r\nKruskal communicates the course content clearly and with a refined taste for what's interesting. He seemed to care less about grades than most other professors, and gave a ridiculous curve. His marking is merciless though- if you do something wrong on a problem then you can expect a 0 or 50% grade for that problem.\n\r\nThe tests were hard, especially the final which was very hard. He puts heavy emphasis on proofs. ","641":"My only real complaint about Kruskal is that he's probably too smart for his own good. Unfortunately, that impacts his teaching significantly. It's frustrating when he insists on only proving things a specific way, and this is the only class I've ever taken in which I really felt like I had to ask questions.\n\r\nThe exams were worth most of the grade which made it a little scary. But if you really do all of the homework on your own and study well, you should do well on the exams (at least relative to other people, which is what matters in this course with regards to your grade). Definitely go over all of the homework questions before taking the exams, and maybe do a few questions from the book.\n\r\nKruskal is very accommodating and cares a lot about his students. He clearly wants to see them do well. I definitely learned a lot in this course and was adequately rewarded for my efforts. It just takes a lot of getting used to his teaching style, and several hours doing and reviewing problems to prepare for the exams.","642":"Class is hard so do not skip any lectures. There were only 4 homeworks but they were challenging and were used on the exams.\n\r\nMidterm was 40%, homeworks 10%, final 50% of grade.\n\r\nMany people drop this class because of his no-regard-for-human-life grading style.\n\r\nI thought I'd fail with a 55 average on the midterm and final exam, but with his curve that was a B.","643":"Kruskal is a great guy. I have had couple of classes with him, and I think he is definitely one of the better professors in the department. His class is entertaining and educational at the same time. Mind you, 451 is a hard class. You learn many complex classes of algorithms, and their mastery can only happen over time. The good thing is Kruskal understands this. His tests aren't super hard if you go through and understand his lectures well. He doesn't give very organized notes (mostly writing on board). Also, there were couple of times when he stumbled a bit solving some problem. But on the whole, I would recommend taking this any\/all algorithms classes with him. Also has a decent grade curve. But go into this class prepared to see some really hard problems.","644":"Great lectures and lecture notes. Comprehensive, lucid, and insightful best described the class. Homework was challenging but quite interesting. Exams were likewise challenging but definitely not impossible if you understood the material. There's a lot of non-linear thinking involved which is not too uncommon for proof-based mathematics courses but may surprise those coming from a traditional CS background.","645":"Good professor but has very high expectations for students.","646":"Great at lecturing. I learned a lot.","647":"Great professor. No slides, but excellent lectures with clear notes on the board.","648":"It is clear that Aravind has a vast knowledge of algorithms, and is very passionate about the subject as well. He teaches the course via lectures based off of the recommended textbook, following very closely to the examples and ideas from the chapters he tells you that you must understand. I found the lectures, if you pay attention, to be very interesting and relevant.\r\nAs for assignments, the course had 5 homework assignments, each giving you a deeper understanding of the topics covered in the past few lectures. They were graded moderately harshly.\r\nThe mid terms were pretty difficult and took the entire class time to complete for almost all of the class. None of the questions were unfair or anything he hadn't covered, and if you do the book problems and redo the homework assignments the tests are manageable. ","649":"Pretty good professor. Cares about his students and is interesting enough. Much better run class than 351 for sure.","650":"Pros:\r\nHe is very smart\r\n\r\nCons:\r\nYou'll never be as smart as he is\r\nThe class is genuinely difficult\r\nHe is a very boring lecturer\r\n","651":"Incredible professor. His lectures are very clear and the expectations for students are very reasonable. This is a challenging class, but it's worth taking because you'll learn a ton.","652":"Childs is probably the best professor I have ever had out of all the other CMSC professors next to Max for 423. Hands down takes the best notes, is easy to follow in class, and he is really interesting (his field of study is quantum algorithms). The only sort-of complaint I have is he doesn't post his notes online, but that never really bothered me and you definitely learn a lot when you're at lecture.\r\n\r\nMore importantly however is how hard this class is. Yes, the first half of the class is 351 material, but with 2 week long assignments and a final that is worth almost half your grade, the class has very little room to make up for lost points easily due to its structure.\r\n\r\nI will say the class was harder than 351 for me, as I had Golub for 351 and received a B at the end, and I wasn't the best at proofs coming in to this class.\r\n\r\nMy advice is if you are VERY confident in your ability to solve proofs then you should definitely take Childs; he's absolutely the best professor for this class. It honestly all comes down to how confident you feel about taking 451.\r\n\r\nP.S: I'm giving 5 stars because Childs is AMAZING, not because of the course material or its difficulty.","653":"Childs is insanely smart; he, for the most part, single-handedly managed the course Piazza. He writes his notes (on an iPad projected to the screen) in a way that students can copy word for word, which is nice when we need to review the concepts, but makes class a frantic effort to copy notes (missing a lot of what Childs has to say verbally).\r\n\r\nHis final was pretty fair in my opinion. He sticks very close to the book \"Algorithm Design\" (available as a PDF online).\r\n\r\n451 is a tough class. I guess it will improve some algorithmic thinking skills.","654":"Probably one of the best professors to have for a difficult class. He almost instantly replies to all Piazza posts, has great lectures, and he is very kind. This class was hard but the material I learned from it was invaluable and absolutely essential for any CS student.","655":"the course is pretty hard in general. there were a lot of smart people when i took the course and exam averages were in the high 60s. \r\n\r\nbut as for andrew childs himself, if you can take this class with him, do it. he is a great lecturer. while he might be fast at times he does address student questions during class. i went to his office hours fairly often and i got a lot of my questions answered and i overall learned a lot in this class. it's a challenge and bit stressful since the final is worth 45% but i think if you did well in 351 (B or higher) and you're interested in learning more about algorithms then take this class with childs. ","656":"Andrew Childs is such an amazing professor. He is clear and calm in his lectures, always willing to re-explain material, and his homeworks and exams are very fair. Not easy, but fair.\r\nWhen I had him, he took notes on an iPad and displayed them on the board as he taught, to show many examples and explain theorems. However, he didn't post those notes - so make sure you take your own!\r\n\r\nOverall, I would want no one else to teach me 451. I feel like I actually learned a lot. I wish he would teach 351 as well!","657":"Truly garbage. Doesn't teach anything--and what's worse--doesn't seem to care. Terrible organization and complete apathy.","658":"While the content of this course is interesting the organizing and implementation is severely lacking. Professors and TA's should respond to students in a timely manner but in this class there was seldom any communication with the students on basic course information ","659":"Textbook definition of a good professor.\r\n- Answers Piazza posts quickly\r\n- Lecture is clear, provides lots of examples\r\n- Handled the transition to COVID online learning very well\r\n- HW's were relevant\r\n- Exams were reflective of HW's and class material\r\n\r\n10\/10 would take again.","660":"I would not take him again because he seems to genuinely not care about any of his students. He has good and interesting lectures but it seems like he doesn't want to spend a second of his time outside of class for the class. Maybe this impression is unique to me but I felt like he didn't care about the students and didn't want to be bothered. ","661":"He has good lectures but this person genuinely does not care about any of his students. He does not want to spend any second on logistics and his replies to piazza posts are very irritating to say the least. I would not take him again. And grades? He says everybody should get an A and does not curve. Grading is not clear at all! We never know what the cutoffs were, we never knew what grades we had until we saw them on Testudo. A complete failure of a professor in my opinion. He also asked if us so many times not to email him. He even said he will not respond to any emails. He genuinely does not want to teach in my opinion. ","662":"Definitely the best professor for CMSC451. The lecture videos are concise, well put together, and very informative. The course was also structured in a way that allowed for a lot of flexibility for students. Exams are fair and you will do well if you do the homework's. Professor Childs is very knowledgeable about algorithms and is also able to answer questions and explain concepts very well. Overall, really enjoyed his class.","663":"\r\n(Disclaimer: had him during fall 2020 virtual semester) \r\n\r\nI found the course a lot easier than 351. The homeworks were a bit challenging but I found that the TAs, at least during this semester, graded very generously (the rubrics are not like 351 where it\u2019s basically 0%, 50%, or 100% per question). The tests were kind of hard to do under a time crunch but they were generally easier than the homeworks and again had generous rubrics. Childs is a nice professor and responsive to the students - he extended the deadline on one of our homeworks. If you\u2019re interested in 451 I recommend taking it with him. ","664":"Childs was really fair, and I felt like a learned a lot through the course. It was challenging, but I could tell that all of the material was important. Grading was fast, and lectures were recorded. Piazza questions were answered quickly. ","665":"Had Dr. Kruskal for CMSC351\/451. He is not perfect, but I absolutely disagree with his 2.87 star rating.\r\n\r\nHe has a good sense of humor and teaches algorithms in a way that makes it very intuitive. He also really makes sure to answer student questions during lectures and is helpful during office hours. One of the biggest complaints is that there is a really long turnaround time before things get graded. This is not any of the TA's or Kruskal's fault. They are simply understaffed for the amount of kids they have to manage. Another complaint is that the tests are completely unfair. This was absolutely not true in 351, where the problems were literally just slightly altered homework problems and problems that reflected lecture material. The tests for 451 I felt were more difficult.\r\n\r\nMany people also leave the class frustrated because they can't seem to get a good grade by rote memorization of the materials. I think that the problems Kruskal gives out on the homeworks and exams are fair for a difficult algorithms class and focused on difficult problem solving. It is, however, very difficult for any teacher to 'teach' a class math maturity or problem solving ability. You are simply going to have to do extra practice practice from the textbook if you haven't done these kids of problems before.\r\n\r\n\r\n","666":"I took this class in Spring 2021. Typically, while most people say that your 451 grade with Kruskal is the same as your 351 grade with Kruskal, I feel as though your 451 grade may be lower. If you choose to take this class with Kruskal, be sure you know what you're doing...\r\nPros:\r\n+ The ridiculously long pre lecture videos from 351 are gone. The professor actually teaches new content during lecture time, making lectures highly informative.\r\n+ He repeats most NP assignments from 351, so you can reuse your work\r\n+ Professor is very chill regarding deadlines. Often, he would extend a homework deadline by a few dates simply because someone asked nicely. Our midterm deadline was actually moved by 2 weeks.\r\nCons:\r\n- The quizzes from 351 that helped gauge your progress are (mostly) gone. We had a few at the beginning of the semester but they stopped afterwards\r\n- There are no written solutions given for any homework assignment (not just NP). This is especially detrimental when exams are often based off of homework assignments. While there are review sessions that go over homework assignments, they lack the formal rigor that a written solution would have. Also, there is no guarantee that the every problem is covered in these sessions. It is especially baffling that we do not have solution keys when this was done so often back in 351.\r\n- The live lectures are often very free-flowing and not directed without the slide set. This can make it difficult to determine what to take notes on.\r\n- No review material is given for either the midterm or final. The homework assignments do not make up for this. As a result, it is very easy to lose lots of points of exam questions where you may actually understand the concepts at hand. Again, exam review material is something that was easily made for 351, so I am shocked that they couldn't apply the same processes here to make it.","667":"This is my second review of kruskal, the first being for CMSC 351, posted on 12\/20\/2020 (search for \"tybug\"). I've changed view slightly; I think he's actually quite a good lecturer, but the class is far too disorganized to get anything above 3 stars, similar to 351. I also didn't learn the things I was most excited for in this class: proving algorithm correctness (formally, not hand waving with a certifier) and learning how to come up with algorithms, not just analyzing existing ones.","668":"Had him for 351\/451. Got a B+ in both classes. Clyde is extremely lazy. When asked to go over some homework problems he may flat out refuse because it's too much work. Best thing you can do is form study groups and learn from other students. Pretty cool guy overall.","669":"The course materials are good and the assignments are very fair. However, I never knew what my grade was in the class since the homework assignments took forever to grade. Idk if it's the fault of the TAs or Katz, but it's an anxiety-inducing issue that Katz cares very little about.","670":"I took this class Fall 2020 (online semester), but I thought Childs was a great professor. He's probably one of the most organized professors in the CS department. His course is heavily dependent on the textbook (which is amazing), but he does a really good job of breaking things down in a digestible way. I would like to say that I'm algorithmically-challenged, but I was still able to follow all of the lectures. He is extremely responsive on Piazza, and very lenient with partial credit. The class is not easy, and you'll definitely need to work for your grade, but overall this is a great class and I would 100% recommend taking it. ","671":"Katz is one of the best Professors at UMD. He is as good as one can get. It\u2019s not only about understanding the concepts, but also thinking fast + critically. This is a skill to be built. After this class, I realized this, and it is probably the best realization in terms of academics I ever had, and something I neglected for so long - I need to learn to think critically + problem solve! Thanks to Katz I know now. Also, when he says anyone can get an A, he is 100% correct, it is all about experience and your ability to think critically (again, a skill that needs to be built from pushing yourself\/practicing!).","672":"Overall a decent class. I'd actually give 3.5 stars out of 5 but I'd figure I round up if I have to decide between a 3 and a 4. \r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- Great lectures\r\n- Comprehensive slides\r\n- Responsive on Piazza. Some people were saying that he's too blunt or rude, but I didn't really feel that way. I appreciate that his responses were to the point.\r\n- Helpful during office hours\r\n- Exams and homeworks were mostly fair\r\n- Useful content for technical interviews and fundamental CS understanding\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Grading took way too long, particularly for the homeworks. However, the final was graded the same day, which is great on them. \r\n- Cutoffs could be more clear\r\n- Lecturing could be a bit slower so that people who are writing notes can copy points from the slides. This is likely because Katz covers more material than other professors.\r\n\r\nKatz may not be as good as Childs for this class, but he is miles better than Kruskal. My main suggestions for him are to try and enforce faster grading and to cover less material to let students have more time to grasp it. Other than that, you should be fine having him as your professor. ","673":"pretty tough class but Childs is a very smart professor who explains content very well. homeworks take a long time (there are only 5 though so it's not terrible). wouldn't recommend taking this course with a heavy schedule but otherwise definitely recommend","674":"Definitely one of the best professors in the department. Explains everything well, and the class definitely felt more manageable than 351, although that's not saying much. Homework is long though, so definitely start early on those.\r\n\r\nIf you're not algorithmically challenged like I am, this class might be fairly easy for you.","675":"Lectures are written on iPad. He keeps lectures interesting by relating algorithms to the history and intent of them in the past. His explanations focus on building intuition for algorithms and he answers questions thoroughly. The class is good for building general algorithms intuition which may help in other coursework. The class is a decent amount of work, the homeworks each take 6-8 hours and are quite difficult. The exams are reasonable. He is open to suggestions since he is new at teaching but he is doing a good job already.","676":"Amazing professor. Makes the material very interesting and got me involved in computer science. I am a business major and he was so good I started coding in my free time!\r\nSome people had trouble with certain parts of the class, but that was not his fault, but a function of the material.\r\nBottom line: Take Fawzi for anything he teaches. He is the man.","677":"Fawzi is a FANTASTIC professor! I entered 122 with absolutely zero knowledge or experience in the subject, and by the end he had me switching my major!  He is exciting in class, extremely fair in his tests, helpful in assigned projects, and if you go to lectures he makes the material incredibly easy and understandable! With computer science, part of it will always be a natural aptness to computers and thinking in code that not everyone has.  However, for beginners and non comp sci majors, Fawzi is more than ready to help and always willing to repeat ideas.  If you are ever stuck, I've never been to a more productive office hours!","678":"Great instructor. His enthusiasm keeps you from falling asleep in his class. Projects aren't too bad, but I've never had programming experience so javascript was difficult for me. I heard he's helpful during office hours but I never went.\r\nTake this if you want comp sci experience, but not if you want an easy DSSP gen ed credit.","679":"Fawzi was a great professor. Anyone saying he taught poorly probably just doesn't like Computer Science, not Fawzi. I don't know how you can make a computer class anymore simple or interesting. The TA's and his own office hours were extremely helpful for the projects. The tests and quizzes were straight from the lecture slides so if you go to class and then review them as study material you will get an A; the final is no exception. \n\r\nI had fun in this class and am now going to declare a Computer Science minor","680":"Programming is not really my thing, but Fawzi made the class more than bearable. His sense of humor and teaching style were very amusing and overall this was a great class. He grades reasonably, and the assignments were mostly pretty cool (except for one of them that drove me up a wall.) BTW, I thoght I was getting a C, but ended up with a B! Fawzi is more than fair when it comes to grades.\n\r\nSomebody else said Fawzi wasn't helpful in office hours, but that's total B.S. I don't know why that kid is so pissed off - Fawzi knows the material backwards and forwards and will go out of his way to make sure you understand it. I got a lot of help in office hours from Fawzi -- he was totally chill.","681":"The class was fun!  Fawzi is truly a gifted instructor and does a great job making sure that everyone learns the material.  I met with him several times during office hours and he was very personable and helpful.  \n\r\nThe exams were very fair (actually, they were pretty easy).  The projects were reasonable, but don't start working on them at the last minute because office hours get crowded on the day the projects are due.\n\r\nThis is a course for beginners, so you don't need to know anything beforehand.  But be prepared to do some work. The projects take a good amount of time and there are frequent quizzes that you'll need to study for.\n\r\nOverall, this was a great class for me -- I learned a lot and enjoyed it quite a bit.","682":"This class consisted of 2 midterms, the final, 10 quizzes, 5 programming projects, and an 8 page paper. The paper sounds bad but it's easy, basically if you do it and it's coherent, you should get an A. \n\r\nThe class is easy in the beginning, until you start talking about Javascript. However, I ended up getting an A in the class and I had no prior programming knowledge whatsoever. He tries to make lectures interesting and talk about things that could be useful and get you interested in computer programming, if you aren't already. \n\r\nThe tests have at most three questions where you have to write programs, and the rest are short answers, so he tries to help out the people who might not be good at writing programs and functions.\n\r\nGood class to take if you are willing to put in a little work for the A.","683":"I'm finishing up CMSC122 with Mr. Emad this semester.  So far (as a second semester Freshman) this is the best class I've had in college. I'm actually changing my major to Computer Science as a result of my experiences in this course. Mr. Emad's teaching style is outstanding -- he is very enthusiastic and his explanations are always logical and easy to understand. The exams were reasonable (not too long and at the right level) and the projects were decent. I'm looking forward to taking CMSC131 with Mr. Emad this summer and continuing on in the major.","684":"1st: If you are a JOURNALISM MAJOR dont take this class with him.  and btw that expected grade is a C if he doesnt act like a complete douche.  He teaches 122 as if you already know coding and caters his class to people that will be majors or are trying to get into the major.  His grading is arbitrary and doesnt give you a rubric for the projects. Sketch. His grading is harsh, unforgiving and frankly unnecessary for an introductory class.  He doesnt curve, but takes off chunks of your grade for senseless things.  \n\r\nHe needs to think more about his audience, which is the key to being a good teacher.  Don't cater your class to people that already know material.  Bring everyone up or reconsider your profession\n\n","685":"Let me begin by saying that CMSC122 is probably one of the most demanding CORE classes out there, and you should take it only if you're willing to LEARN something (not a class where you can beat around the bush and get an A). With that said, Dr. Emad makes the rigorous challenge of learning a programming language for the first time insanely fun. He's a great guy, and overall a professor that can actually TEACH. I usually suck at programming, but because of his guidance, I can actually program independently now. You will have to work your tail off in his class, but trust me, in the end it's the most accomplished feeling you'll ever have. Wish I actually majored in Compsci now, since he made everything seem so interesting! ","686":"Very friendly and approachable person. Clearly passionate and knowledgeable. Unfortunately, he has apparently injured his clavicle from years of writing on the board, so he gave lectures from a PowerPoint. He seemed a little out of his comfort zone.\n\r\nNonetheless, great professor. If you know nothing of HTML, CSS, or Javascript he'll make sure you do by the end of the class! Always has office hours and always willing and able to address any concerns.","687":"In all honesty, I don't know why everyone is praising Nelson. Maybe it is because they didn't have him for CMSC122. Seriously, don't take this class. It is just a bunch of unneeded stress. \n\r\nNelson is the first teacher that I've ever had that actually discouraged asking questions. I asked him reasonable questions during lecture and he not only didn't answer them, he makes an example of me in front of the class. \n\r\nHe also teaches the class as if it is a bunch of grad students or something. He goes super fast and will once in a while ask us if he is going to fast. When I told him he was, he proceeded to go at the same pace.\n\r\nHe is also very inaccessible. He often ignores emails or sends back nasty messages saying things that frankly, I don't understand. The TA's also don't show up to class so when you go into office hours (which also suck) you don't know who they are. \n\r\nI went to a lot of the lectures, but I found myself learning more from a friend in a 2 hour period than I did all year with him.\n\r\nI noticed that computer science is a thing that comes natural to some and not to others. If you are like me and know nothing, seriously reconsider taking this class. ","688":"He's a good professor and will take every single question you have. His jokes are hilarious the first few days, but then he starts to recycle and it gets old and awkward fast. Which is fine because he really does break down the material into manageable pieces for someone like me who has never done a bit of programming in my life.\n\r\nThere are quizzes but he tells you when they are. He threatens pop-quizzes sometimes because a few weeks in no one listens to him anymore because he moves on to miscellaneous and useless topics after JavaScript, but he never pulled it. \n\r\nMake sure to ask him questions in class though because once that clock strikes 1:50 (or whenever the class ends), he is outta there. Won't answer your questions and isn't helpful in office hours. Go to the TA's for that, and that's what he tells you. \n\r\nI'm taking this as a programming requirement for my math major so if you need one and want to do minimal work, take this course with Nelson.","689":"This is by far the worst class at any level of education I have ever taken in my life. The syllabus did not describe the guidelines in the class at all. It just listed that there would be projects at some time during the semester but students were not informed of when projects were due until they were assigned. The professor also assigned a major assignment each week about halfway through the semester. I never had a break from this class. I was always either working on a project or studying for a test or quiz. I understand that there will be assignments, but I never had more work in any class of college so far and I have taken some 400-level classes.\n\r\nWhen I had questions about some of the assignments, I would go to both the professor and the TA's office hours. However, once I was there, I received no help. I was told to look over the powerpoint slides again and then turned away. My questions were not answered at all.\n\r\nThe lectures for this class were incredibly boring. The teaching style was horrible. At the beginning of the semester, Nelson said he did not care what students did during his class. Yet throughout the semester, he constantly called out students for talking, texting or typing on their computer. His lecture style was not engaging at all. It was so hard to focus and he did not gear the information at all to people who are not great with computers like myself. Whenever students asked questions, his answers were not helpful at all. \n\r\nWorst class ever. Do not take this if you are not great with computers and are not a computer science major.","690":"She is very nice and tried very hard (saw her a couple times at office hours), but just didn't teach the stuff well. One problem is the class doesn't really have homework. She expects us to create situations that we would use the code. In a normal comp. sci class that could fly, but this is an intro class! Anyway the material wasn't that hard, but I had to teach myself everything, which made it harder. A+ for my TA though (I don't know if shell be there next semester)","691":"The class itself is not hard. Unlike what the person below me had said, I had no problems when it came to midterms (92.2% avg), projects (99% avg), or the labs that I had done at home with very little difficulty. I have previous programming experience in MATLAB from PHYS165 so most of aspects of the class were already familiar to me and I had no difficulty adapting to slightly different terms and methods. If you know MATLAB, you should be fine.\r\nHowever, you should be aware of the fact that many of the students with 0 experience had a very hard time. Some did not do well on exams, needed help on projects, and were continually relying on the TAs to dig them out of holes.\r\nWith that said, Plane is completely unresponsive to student concerns. In one case, i had an issue that I had contacted her about. She replied very promptly and I thought we had resolved it, but she took no action. So I contacted her again. And again. And again. No reply, no action taken. Because of her lack of activity and willingness to help, I'll be getting an entire letter grade lower because the issue at hand was worth about 8% of the total point breakdown. If this doesn't convince you that she doesn't care about your concerns, I don't know what else to tell you.\r\nIf you have a definite need to take this class with Plane, I suppose you don't have a choice... However, if you get another professor, you're probably in better hands.","692":"I am currently taking this course with Plane, and I would like to say that she is a very kind woman and really does want to see her students succeed, however wanting to help them succeed and actually doing it are two different things. You will struggle in this course if you have no prior Computer Science experience, which is why I took the class. As others have said before, in her  other computer science courses her lectures are so basic that when it comes time for quizzes and tests you have no idea what to do. Not to mention she only gives 10 minutes to do these quizzes which are too complicated for a class at this level. The tests were equally as difficult and on more than one occasion almost the entire class did not finish on time.\n\r\nAs soon as you get to JavaScript you better hope that you don't fall behind or else your grade will be ruined. Don't expect your TAs to help you either because they don't speak English.\n\r\nAs for projects they are also extraordinarily complicated for what you learn in the class. There is no way you can do these without help and I recommend starting them as soon as they are assigned. There are weekly \"In class labs\" that are supposed to help you do these projects and understand the material better, but after the first week of class she leaves you to do them on your own with no help.\n\r\nShe is a very nice woman but do not take this class if you want an elective and are new to Computer Science, you will most certainly regret it. You can learn about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on your own for free without being so brutally penalized.","693":"Super, super, super, super helpful. Works around the clock to answer questions on Piazza, holds 5 hours of extra office hours near project deadlines, writes practice exams and holds review sessions. Lifesaver!","694":"Terrible teacher. not engaging at all and regurgitates the slides. this was an intro class yet our exam averages were in the 50% range. do not take this unless you absolutely have to","695":"His lectures are fine, but can be unbearably slow and monotone. Tests and quizzes were OK as long as you kept up with your lectures. He didn't really interact with students much, but the class was fully online so I can't say that I expected anything different. ","696":"Lectures are on the boring side but the course was run will completely remote. The exams were mental difficulty because they were take home. The three midterms were supposed to take 1 hour but they took me 3-5 hours.","697":"Yoon definitely knows what he's talking about, and he goes into the small details about programming. But his exams and quizzes are extremely difficult, and he didn't give us a lot of time for the final project. The only thing that's a saving grace in this class is that his curves are insane, I went up two letter grades from my original percentage ","698":"The best and most understanding professor ever. Best teacher and class I have taken.","699":"His lectures can be a bit dry, and it's a little bit of a struggle to pay attention sometimes, but that's totally not his fault. He's a really informative lecturer and all the examples he does in class are great for helping to illustrate the concepts. The projects are pretty fun, and he gives plenty of time for you to work on them. The quizzes and tests are always on exactly what he says they will be -- no surprises there. If you study (do the worksheets he posts!) you'll be fine. The TAs were great, and Pedram says he's always pretty picky about who he lets TA his courses, so I trust that it would be the same in other semesters. This was the first coding class I've ever taken and it was my favorite this semester. ","700":"Sometimes I cannot believe Professor Manly is even real. She is one of the kindest, sweetest people I have ever met. Her passion for teaching and her love for her students are clearly demonstrated through her continued preparation for class, challenging but reasonable workload, among many other things. If you're new to programming, this is the professor you'll want to have. She will get you interested in computer science and keep you excited to show up to class. ","701":"Great professor with a genuine love\/understanding for teaching and her students. If you are new to programming like I was she is the teacher for you. Her class is moderately challenging but she gives many chances to turn in late work for full credit and will heavily curve tests if needed. Overall great class and teacher.","702":"Great professor. Good class if you're new to programming. ","703":"Great professor, really wants to see student achieve.","704":"It is enough to say that he needs a lot of things to be a good professor. ","705":"The professor does have some pretty bad anxiety at times and it can be really uncomfortable for the students, but overall he is a great professor. His explanations can be extremely in depth and hard to follow but he does not expect you to be able to derive those explanations for yourself, just to build some intuition as to why things work. His homework\u2019s were pretty difficult but he would give out tips and answers when students were really struggling, his exams were extremely fair and very similar to his sample exams. I recommend taking this class with Dr Petersdorff.","706":"Professor Doboszczak is a great professor. As an engineering major I have taken just a few math courses throughout my degree.... and Stefan is definitely one of the best I've had. He doesn't just go over the most basic example in lecture and give you the hardest problems to solve for homework. He gives a great balance of examples and theoretical explanations and gives challenging but solvable homework problems. He gives great practice exams and plenty of additional resources to learn the material. The only downside is that he doesn't release answer keys to the practice exams. So you should work on them well before the exam so you can get assistance from him or the TA's if you're stuck. The course, though being titled computational methods, has a lot of cool information regarding the IEEE floating point standard, how computers store numbers, and how to figure out how accurate your answer can be on a given machine (single precision vs double precision). The second half of the course I found to be more challenging as it is the more theoretical mathematical concepts you see on the course description (interpolation, quadrature, differentiation, etc). I was weary to take this class after being required to take so many math courses -- but I actually enjoyed every lecture I watched because of Stefans teaching. I would 100% recommend this course to anyone that has the option to take it. ","707":"Unfortunately, Hal was disappointing. At first, he seemed like he'd put a tremendous amount of effort into the class and that we would learn a lot. After the first 3 weeks though, he stopped putting any effort, and taught extremely poorly. We barely covered any material, and he made the final trivial. I wouldn't recommend him for anyone who wants to learn: though he does make the class very very easy (16% extra credit absolute).","708":"Very good","709":"Friendly guy, not the best teacher or course. Curves well","710":"Ramani is a friendly teacher, but I don't think he taught 422 that well. Lectures were sort of boring, and he doesn't really explain concepts in an intuitive, understandable way.","711":"Friendly and knowledgeable. Good curve at end. Good intro to ML concepts, as it is not too thorough and covers a good amount of material. ","712":"pretty chill prof, understanding of personal issues. the class isn't too difficult for a 400 level class, but i took this class during the covid pandemic so that might have skewed the difficulty of class(making it easier). either way if he's teaching take it with him!","713":"Worst taught course ever. This course was co-taught by him and David Jacobs, and I ended up skipping my other CS class to go to Jacobs' discussions. If you have the option please take Jacobs instead. Dr. Duraiswami simply reads over slides, didn't truly teach anything, especially if it related to the weekly quizzes or the final, and wouldn't go over quiz answers because somehow we're magically supposed to \"understand\" what we were never actually taught. He also would make a lot of errors, which is perfectly human, but it was never corrected, and some of us can't tell what's right\/wrong to be able to immediately correct him. As a result, I never had any real material to study off of and didn't learn enough to know whether what he did was actually correct or not. Also, office hours were very limiting and didn't help much with problem sets. Overall, poorly taught class, and would not take a course with him again.","714":"Professor Huang is a good instructor, but the course is poorly designed in my opinion. She was very generous with grades (due to the pandemic probably), and the class material was pretty straightforward. The homeworks in the form of ELMS quizzes make it feel like you don't learn much that much though.","715":"Lectures are handwritten, which is horrible. They request you read the textbook before the lecture, but then review it verbatim, therefore making reading the textbook feel a little frustrating. However, he is quite knowledgeable and communicates content pretty effectively.\r\n\r\nHe combines his lectures with the other professor, and it just ended up being really annoying. Especially since the other professor was significantly worse at teaching than he was.","716":"I took this course in Fall 2021\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n+ Generally nice guy\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Is a meh lecturer, I do not feel as though his explanations of concepts were sufficient\r\n- Lectures are handwritten, and is often hard to read\r\n- Lecture notes are not easily available in one place, they were on Piazza but not readily organized, and half of them weren't even there.\r\n- Lecture barely helps with coding assignments\r\n- THE CLASS IS VERY DISORGANIZED! Along with what I've already said, lectures were delivered during the Tuesday morning section and the Thursday afternoon section. However, since you are only scheduled for either the morning or afternoon section, you would either have to find some way to get there in time, or (most likely), watch the lecture videos which are extremely long. They did not make it clear how exactly content was split up between both of those classes, or what quizzes were on what concepts, and it took me about a month and a half to figure out how the class was organized.\r\n- Workload is very high, even for a 3 credit CS class","717":"I took this course in Fall 2021\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n+ Generally nice guy\r\n+ Pretty good curve\r\n+ Pretty good lecturer\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Some lectures, especially towards the end, seemed irrelevant to the course, only for them to appear on the final. This seemed unfair, especially when it was alluded that the topics were auxiliary to the course\r\n- Lecture notes are not easily available in one place, they were on Piazza but not readily organized, and half of them weren't even there.\r\n- Lecture barely helps with coding assignments\r\n- THE CLASS IS VERY DISORGANIZED!

It is quite possibly one of the worst taught classes I have ever taken at UMD, mostly because of how its run. \r\n\r\n1. Class Structure - This class is the most disorganized class in the CS department. Jacobs and Duraiswami co-teach, so even if you are in Jacobs's section you'll still have to deal with lectures from Duraiswami (and vice versa if you're in the other section). For some reason the professors thought it was okay to essentially add another \"period\" of mandatory content. We had in-person lecture on Tuesday, and Thursdays were reserved for \"discussion\" where we would do actual practice problems instead of theory. However, before the next week's Tuesday lecture, you were expected to watch the recorded lecture from the other section. So basically, even though you only registered for two 1 hr 15 min periods, you effectively had to complete 3 to make the most out of the class. Another issue is that none of the resources are centralized. They post the jamboard from lecture in the resources section of piazza, but discussion problems and jamboards are lost within the sea of piazza questions. Some of them were missing, and in general it was extremely difficult to access the content in a systematic way. \r\n\r\n2. Content -  I ended up self teaching a lot of the content in this class. During lectures, both professors tended to ramble and never really seemed to hit the point. Rather than using structured slides, they taught freely while writing things on a Google Jamboard (essentially a virtual whiteboard). This is fine if you know exactly what you want to talk about, but unfortunately Jacobs had a tendency to make a lot of mistakes and get confused while teaching. I never retained anything from lecture until I googled things on my own to learn them. I also felt like the general flow of topics could have been a little better. \r\n\r\n3. Responsiveness & Grading- This class had one of the worst Piazza response rates. There were times where I would have questions that went over 4 days unanswered. This was especially problematic when a project was due the same week. A lot of times responses were also not that helpful. For example, I remember someone asked for clarification on one of the questions from the final review, and a professor responded with \"I don't see what's unclear with this solution,\" and then did not respond to the student's followup. The grading in the class was also extremely slow. Problem sets and quizzes from the middle of october were only graded in the last couple weeks of the semester. Solutions were not released until the last week either, which made it very difficult to study or even know where you stand in the class before the withdraw deadline. I understand that grading of written problem sets takes time, but in general it felt like there was no communication between instructors and TAs.\r\n\r\nOverall I was extremely disappointed with the class, especially given that I love machine learning. Some pros are that the professors were nice and generally approachable. There was also a decent curve at the end which helped boost a lot of grades. I'm sure both Jacobs and Duraiswami are smart people, but I think they did a pretty bad job teaching. I would take 422 with different professors if you can. ","719":"Generally a good professor for ML. Pretty responsive to student questions and very helpful\/accessible especially during OHs. Overall, the class covered what I thought to be a pretty good range of different topics in ML appropriate for an introductory course, providing a solid foundation on the fundamentals including multivar calc, inner product, supervised learning, bayesian reasoning, and neural networks. Also, there were lectures on special topics(eg. GANs, transformers, CV,  ect) that were really interesting. Although, the class\/lectures did feel a bit unstructured\/disconnected at times due to 2 professors coteaching the course. Also, especially for those with a background in ML, the class material did feel a bit shallow and didn't rigorously cover some of the algorithms eg. SVMs to the level I would have liked\r\n\r\nBut overall, Prof Jacobs is a pretty solid choice and CMSC422 does offer what I think to be a good primer into the ML field that can be easily built upon through more advanced ML\/DL courses.","720":"Decent instructor but the course is planned very poorly. She gives a decent curve but the homework quizzes were quite difficult and the exams were very abstract. The study material never seemed to help and i spent a lot longer than I should have on the assignments. Shes a good professor, but the class is going to be a challenge","721":"Dr. Huang is a friendly professor and willing to help students but she expects students to have a higher math background than indicated by the course prereqs which makes following lectures difficult. The homeworks and exams are not exactly related to the content in the slides, and the projects do not have much detail, which overworks the TAs who have to answer all the holes in the projects. Despite this I still recommend her because she is very nice.","722":"Incredibly caring professor. She makes an effort and it shows. Take her class and you won't regret it. It's by no means an easy A, but also not too difficult. ","723":"Great professor who cares a lot about bioinformatics and the success of his students. Fun (well, as fun as lectures can be) classes and interesting presentation. Lots of tiny programming assignments that weren't harder than 330, but the last two can be a little bit of a pain. His exams are really fair, pretty much only covers what has been said in course unless he explicitly stated it. I'd recommend to final semester seniors.","724":"Not a very captivating lecturer. Uses Socrative (basically clicker questions) to measure participation, but by the end of the semester most of the class was not attending anyway. Exams were difficult to approach with no previous exams or many practice problems to study from. Programming projects are through Rosalind, which means you can use whatever language you choose (pick Python), but debugging is sometimes difficult. Overall - low workload, interesting subject matter, often boring lecture.","725":"Class is great if you have any interest in biology! The workload was extremely manageable, with one program due every other week in the language of your choice. There was quite a bit of jargon to learn, but the in class worksheets were very reflective of the exam material. \r\nThe exams were weighted 90% in class individual grade and then 10% group grade. We had to meet with a group out of class and fill out the exam again together, which was a free 100. He also provided an extra credit assignment at the end of the semester for ~2%\r\nOverall a very understanding teacher who knows what he is talking about","726":"Awesome","727":"Dr. Pop was a wonderful professor this online semester. He spent the whole summer planning for the class and it showed. His lectures helped clarify the confusing parts of the textbook. He had a generous late policy for programming assignments and quizzes and was very helpful in office hours. Highly recommend.","728":"Passionate teacher and very understanding about stress and potential extenuating circumstances during online classes. He provided many ways for us to manage deadlines for projects and exams.","729":"As someone who has mental health problems and turns things in late a lot, pop's class was perfect for me. His class is a decent amount of work, but I excelled at it because of the way he taught and walked away learning a lot. ","730":"Avoid her.\r\nThe teaching material seem to be taken completely from Prof. Mihai Pop which is completely fine but the grading and assignments are harder.\r\nFew programming assignments remain the same but she has added many more which makes the work load a lot. The exams are really hard. The average midterm 1 and 2 was around 40-50\/100. \r\nI took this course cause my friend said it's easy who took it with Mihai but that is not the case here. She made it unnecessarily hard.","731":"Why she shouldn't teach again:\r\n\r\n1) She didn't teach one topic during the entire semester. All of her lectures were video links to Mihai Pop's old lecture videos.\r\n2) She expects one programming assignment every week (13 in total), without covering the material in depth.\r\n3) Midterms were hard for no reason and she wouldn't give any practice material.\r\n4) She would give points on the midterm and then remove them later on (\"in order to maintain standardization\") ?????\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","732":"She gave us lectures on maybe half of the material for the class and used a previous teacher's videos for the other half. The average response time on Piazza is a lot slower than other classes, exam averages were lower than expected (even though the average seems to be around a C+, maybe scraping a B-, she said previous to the final that there likely wouldn't be a curve, even though the exams are what's hurting our grades). She is accommodating with late work, but overall I felt a disconnect and the learning experience was strange. I don't know how to put it, exactly. She seems nice, and tries to put in effort for helping us understand the material, but it's in ways that aren't typical (for example, making detailed modules on ELMS instead of teaching it in lecture). ","733":"Ok so I already gave a review, but the final questions did not line up very well with the amount each subject was taught. It was very disappointing. One question that was worth a big chunk of the grade wasn't even covered in class, and could only be solved likely by using the textbook explanation. Disheartening. ","734":"I had professor Meisel for 423 and thought the class was alright. It is true that most of the lecture videos were from a previous professor but that didn\u2019t bother me as much as the other reviewers below. The weekly quizzes were free points from the lectures and the weekly programming assignments had most of the information from the textbook. The 2 midterms and final were pretty difficult, but the averages for them were 61\/77\/79 respectively, which is low but not as bad as one of the reviews states. In general, it would take her a while to respond on piazza but there were many times when she gave lots of detailed information on student questions which I thought was good. Finally, the grading at the end was super generous as she gave a 5% curve and did not give any minuses for letter grades. Overall, the course was far from perfect but all things considered, the class was one of the better 400 level cs courses that I have taken at umd and I would recommend to take it. ","735":"Some students are so bitter that they'll lie about midterm averages. That 40-50 score was out of 60, not 100. \r\n\r\nIt is true that Meisel recycled lecture videos, but she was helpful on Piazza. Sometimes she was unresponsive, but she always provided quality responses. \r\n\r\nThe multiple choice part of the exams were straightforward and easy. If you actually keep up with the content and don't leave it til the night before However, you'll be fine. \r\n\r\nHowever, some of the written response questions were tough. Similar to 351, you can't be 100% prepared for them. Still, she gives a generous amount of partial credit.\r\n\r\nFinally, she had a generous curve. Salt is everywhere, just stay diligent and you won't end up like them ","736":"Professor Meisel is fairly new to teaching the class and because of that she made a few mistakes. She has very promising potential and accepted feedback on issues that students had with certain aspects of the class (i.e. the first midterm). That midterm tanked my grade but she gave lots of resources to help study for future exams and adjusted the difficulty of these exams.\r\nShe is the most approachable professor I have ever had. She had office hours four times a week and made time for anyone who couldn't meet during those times. \r\nI found that reading the book was important in understanding the concepts in depth.\r\nThere was a programing assignment every week (except midterm weeks) they could be done in most popular languages (Java, Ruby, rust, etc.) but python is preferred. Pseudocode for each assignment was either in the book or a modification of something in the book. Start the projects when they are assigned as they are due in a week and you may need help in OH.\r\nThe exams were 60% MCQ\/fill in the blank and 40% short answer (final was 50\/50) the MCQ was straightforward especially if you did well on the quizzes. The short answer was problem solving based on the topics covered in class and was harder but lots of partial credit was awarded","737":"This is certainly one of the best classes I have ever taken. The way it has been managed this semester is absolutely impeccable! The presentations are extremely high-quality, and the instruction is thorough and effective, to say the least. As far as curriculum, the topics covered are modern and applicable to the real world. The projects are well-designed and challenging without being made artificially difficult through secret tests or other quirks, and they greatly help in understanding key parts of the course content. The exams are fair and thought-provoking, with algorithm design problems that students can be reasonably expected to know how to solve. (The exam review problems and topics are very reflective of the real deal, which is very helpful.) Finally, the teacher himself is great! He is able to answer any question posed to him in class or on Piazza and clearly has a great deal of passion and subject knowledge. It's truly fantastic!","738":"Run as fast as you can. Never in my years at UMD with multiple CS upper levels taken did I get a prof so out of touch with what students can do. He played the victim when half the class got a 50% on project 1, and sent a huge email to the whole class blaming students for \"being unprepared\" and that they \"asked for too much help on the project.\" This is an INTRO to bioinformatics class, why would you expect students to not struggle, they have no background on this material!?  In 2020 when he taught for the first time at UMD, he gave two projects. Suddenly for 2021 (his second time), he thought SIX would be acceptable. Ended up \"only\" doing five, and projects easily took 20-50 hours a week and you only get two weeks to do them when you should get a month for the level (because you have to write everything from scratch, he gives NO skeleton code and it's implementing ridiculous data structures and algorithms that he is only theoretical about and shows hardly any code for in lectures.) He passive aggressively ignores Piazza posts on days the projects are due and emails from students asking for appointments (his syllabus says that he is available for that, which is a lie.) His two midterms exams are impossible, averages were both a D, exam 2 a D-, all he had to say was \"but I wanted it to be a B.\" Again, not understanding his expectations are ridiculous for what undergrad students can handle. The TAs he had were two graduate students with one hour each of office hours a week, so don't even try asking them for help. They do not know anything about the class either because they haven't taken it and don't care to learn it to the depth the professor expects. ","739":"Professor is very kind and extremely helpful.","740":"I can't recommend Professor Patro enough especially for a course like CMSC423, and this class deserves high remarks both for how well it's run and the material conveyed. First of all, he is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about algorithms\/bioinformatics(as evidently seen by his research background and his lectures), but even more than that, he has the unique talent of conveying even the most difficult material in a way that is very easy to digest while not watering down the material. Moreover, during my years at UMD, I have not come across a professor that has been as responsive during OH and piazza as Prof. Patro - even during late hours\/weekends\/hours before exams and project deadlines. His piazza posts in particular are godsend - extremely detailed and posted in a timely manner. Course policies are very straightforward and made very clear for everyone, and even with the constraints of having only 2 other additional TAs for a 90+ student class, the course is very well run and provides a good primer into the vast area of bioinformatics and computational biology, especially on algorithms related to fully-text indexing, sequence alignment, genome\/transcript assembly, and basic phylogenomics.\r\n\r\nMake no mistake, the course material is fairly challenging(obviously since it's 400-level algorithms course) and does require a fair amount of work\/effort, especially on a personal basis after lectures, to really understand and gain intuition for the algorithms and data structures covered over the semester. Your grade is entirely based on the level of effort and interest you put into the course - by starting projects early, going to OH's, actively attending lecture, I promise you a good grade will follow. Furthermore, the knowledge gained is invaluable for algorithms and bionfo enthusiasts and can help provide an entrypoint to a rewarding research career.\r\n\r\nOverall, over my years at UMD CS, he is easily the best professor I've had the pleasure of learning from.","741":"This is by far the worst class I've ever taken. As a senior, that's definitely saying something. Patro seems really passionate about the subject and is usually pretty responsive on Piazza, but that's pretty much where any praise for this class ends. He obviously puts a lot of work into creating lectures and slides, but the issue is that they are so complicated that a lot of students have trouble understanding the material and end up having to spend a ton of time outside of class to learn it. The course is focused on teaching a lot of different algorithms that are relevant to bioinformatics, but weirdly most of the time he doesn't actually show how they work with examples, so it can be confusing. Also, much less important but the lectures are usually very dry\/boring in my opinion.\r\n\r\nProjects:\r\nThere isn't any homework for this class, only projects. He planned to give us 6 projects throughout the semester, but only ended up giving us 4 mandatory projects and a 5th extra credit project because students struggled so much on projects that he was very reluctantly forced to extend the deadlines of 2 projects. For example, the average on the first project was a 50%. It's worth pointing out that he seems out of touch with how difficult these projects are since he seemed confused by how low the average on this project was and the projects only got harder from there. His projects are also graded in a weird way where it can be pretty hard to get partial credit (hence a lot of people getting 0s on them). When he releases a project, you usually have exactly 2 weeks to complete it. Normally, this would be plenty of time to do it. However, he makes his projects extremely difficult and they take like 35+ hours to finish. Since most students at this level are taking 3-5 other classes, most of which are probably upper level classes, this is a crazy amount of work.\r\n\r\nExams:\r\nThis class has 2 midterms and a final exam. The averages on both midterms were Ds. He showed us the grade distribution for midterm 2 and according to that about 38% failed it. He gave a few practice questions before both midterm exams, but honestly they were so much easier than the actual exams that it wasn't helpful. He and the TAs didn't host any review sessions although they were requested multiple times. Personally, I found a bunch of his exam questions pretty unreasonable. From what I could tell, most students found his exams difficult.\r\n\r\nI heard a lot of good things about CMSC 423 with Pop. I regretted taking this class (with Patro instead of Pop) a couple weeks after the schedule adjustment period ended when I saw what the class would really be like. Apparently, a bunch of students felt the same way because even though we started with about 93-95 students, by the end of the semester there were only 75 of us left. It seemed like a lot of people took a W to get out of the class, which is pretty telling of how rough it is... I would take notice of how only those who got very high grades in his class are giving him good rankings. ","742":"Probably the most understanding professor I've ever had. The entire class was basically asynchronous, every week we had a online \"mini-exam\" (called End Of Module Assessment) that wasn't too bad, you could easily get full points on a lot of them. The in-person lectures themselves are review of the videos we have to watch before class, but he goes in more depth and they are helpful for the end of module assessments and the final exam. Has a great late policy for projects (you're allowed to turn them in late if you write a reflection as to why you failed to turn them in on time). The projects themselves weren't too bad, most of them you can complete in less than two hours. My only problem with this class is the amount of quizzes each week. It's not a lot, but they were all due on Tuesday, even for material that he wasn't going to cover in class until Thursday. The final was somewhat difficult, but in the end he curved pretty well after accounting for this. Overall, Mihai Pop is a great professor to take for CMSC423 and I heavily recommend him. ","743":"Professor Pop was very accommodating to students: he offered both in-person and Zoom recorded\/streamed classes and allowed you to propose your own deadline for some assignments. The workload was also very reasonable. Make sure to study for the final; it was a bit difficult. ","744":"Great professor - it's a challenging, but incredibly rewarding class especially if you are interested in learning the fundamentals of bioinformatics algorithms and data structures. Makes it twice as worthwhile when the professor is really passionate about the subject and wants students to succeed. ","745":"This was a very challenging but incredibly rewarding class. It was one of the best I've ever taken in my 4 years at UMD.  Professor Patro is very knowledgable about the subject and has a passion for it. He was insanely responsive on Piazza.\r\n\r\nThe  course teaches advanced data structures and algorithms, a lot of stuff you won't see in other classes.  Some of the material is genuinely difficulty, but the professor is willing to explain it multiple times and in different ways, and to expand things and answer questions during office hours and on Piazza.  Some reviews on here complain about the workload, but if you're taking a 400 level CS class at UMD and you can't put together an algorithm covered in the class or figure out how to compile a program from the command line, you're gonna have a bad time. Personally, I thought the projects required effort but were totally fair.\r\n\r\nThe material was super interesting, and we learned about data structures that have runtimes I wouldn't have even though were possible before I took this class. What I learned about dynamic programming alone was worth it. The exams definitely made you think, but were fair \u2014 they tested your knowledge of the data structures and algorithms we learned by asking you to use them to solve problems that would be very difficult otherwise.  The averages on the exams were on the low end, but there was a huge curve and the professor was very clear about this up front.  Also, there was a ton of extra credit offered.  Overall, I loved this class. If you're looking for an easy, low-effort 400 level class, don't take this! But if you're willing to put in effort and want to learn some really cool data structures and algorithms, I can't recommend this class highly enough.","746":"Patro is a very, very lovely gentleman. He is good at what he teaches, obviously. \r\nBut, I would avoid this class with Patro specifically unless you are very interested in the topic. \r\n\r\nHis projects are challenging. The projects expect you to write library-quality code. Ridiculously difficult and time-consuming. Lectures are also really confusing and hard to understand. \r\n\r\nI wouldn't trust all the other comments saying, \"wow, a tough class, but you will get a ton out of it.\" No, you won't! \r\nThe lectures are so complex that even if you manage to understand them, which you won't, by the way- the exam's mean was in the 50s despite lenient grading; you will absolutely forget the material the day after the final cause it's just useless. \r\n\r\nTake it with Pop. Avoid Patro. Patro is too enthusiastic about the topic and has made the course unnecessarily tricky.","747":"Don't take Patro. Just don't.\r\nThese reviews are too positive to the point that I feel like he himself comes here occasionally and leaves a nice thing for his future self.","748":"I liked this class. Some of the material is hard, but the algorithms are really cool, and stuff you won't see in other classes. He walks through a lot of examples for the algorithms and the projects have you implement some of them. For me, this helped me to really understand how and why they are working. You have to program things, but this is a CS course.  Some of the exam questions were hard, but the grading was fair, and he explained on piazza and in class what to expect on the exams and in terms of a curve.  My average in the class was around 80, I ended up with an A-, and I learned some cool stuff. I'd recommend this class if you want to learn bioinformatics algorithms, otherwise, I wouldn't take a class on bioinformatics algorithms.","749":"The worst class I've ever taken at UMD. There is no way someone would rate this class as a five-star. It's low-key him trying to make y'all take it. \r\nThe attendance is 5 people\/ session. Not worth the headache, trust me. Go take a class that is a headache but at least teaches you something.","750":"Patro is very knowledgeable in bioinformatics but the class was just a headache all around. Programming assignments were hard to understand and can easily take 45+ hours to complete and even then I wasn't able to get a fully working solution. TA's weren't too helpful as they would never offer any advice on the actual coding of the projects and only offered general advice which makes spending the time to go to office hours feel like a waste of time. Exams were also really difficult and the \"study guides\" he provides do not reflect how difficult the exams were going to be. I honestly did not enjoy the lectures either as he goes through topics so quickly that I honestly dreaded this class as time went on. Avoid him if you can and take this class w\/ another professor. (I took this class during the Fall 2021 semester)","751":"Great professor who really knows the material and does a great job of teaching it to students. Very fair on exams and projects, and really treats his students with courtesy and respect. One of the best professors in the University, and a leader in the field of HCI.","752":"Golub is, well, Golub. This class is fun, but he can really make things serious about the designs and implementations. Design mocks required hours of effort (in a team), but were kinda satisfying in the end. It's a pretty chill class, but I don't recommend skipping too many classes - he seems to love random pop quizzes. Tests were pretty much right off the slides, and the homeworks were just 1-2 page question and answer things. If you take this course, be prepared to spend some time out of class for the project. Designing something in Android can take hours to make look pretty. ","753":"Had him for 131 and 434 and I learned that he is good in teaching non coding classes. I hated him so much for 131 but really liked him for 434. He was so organized in 434. Lectures were still boring but they were informative. Project descriptions were extremely well organized. In 434 there is a big group project. If you follow all of his directions, you should get a good grade in class. ","754":"Can't really complain too much about Dr. Sawazhal. Her class is easy as can be. The in class activities are an easy handful of points, her exams are open note, her semester long project isn't too daunting with groups. \r\n\r\nNice woman, very laid back but can be a little picky with her grading especially on the miscellaneous homework assignments. \r\n\r\nIf you want an Easy A\/B, take her for 434 not Golub","755":"Lectures are a complete waste of time, except for the participation points. The material he plans to cover in class, on paper, looks to be interesting, but he completely butchers every topic with long anecdotes, and extreme bias.","756":"The professor is nice, but the lectures are kinda boring. You don't really need to go to class, especially when they are zoom meetings. The grading of the exams seems strict to me. The average of the exams is also lower than I expected. The group project really takes some amount of time, if you have bad teammates then good luck on dealing with them. ","757":"Avoid taking this course with Golub at all costs. Grading is based purely on his opinion, which is impossible to predict. Project descriptions are absolutely useless. You put in a lot of work and are not rewarded.","758":"The course is fairly interesting, simple, and mostly theory\/definition based. Golub is very engaged in the course and answers questions quickly but his assignment descriptions are vague and because of that, he grades harshly if he feels like a group\/student did not follow what he wants (even though it wasn't really specified in the description.) If you go over the Panopto lectures (which are divided into small video sections) and work well as a team, you should be fine. Ask Golub questions if you are doubting anything because of his description vagueness.","759":"I had Professor Golub for CMSC434. The biggest weakness from the course is the lack of directions and the grading. A lot of the assignments that are given have very vague instructions, so it can be frustrating to see the feedback when you never knew that you were suppose to include something. However, the class is not really that difficult. The most important thing is making sure that you have a good group because a majority of your grade will rely on the assignments that you complete as a team. I would recommend to take this class in the same section as a few of your friends so that you will at least know who you are working with and that they will contribute equally.","760":"Super nitpicky\/strange grading, can be frustrating as it feels like he's desperate to lower the class average. Would honestly prefer a down curve instead.","761":"This was an insightful and relatively easy class, and the professor was very nice and receptive to feedback. His lectures were interesting and included a lot of interaction with the audience, so they were never too boring.\r\n\r\nThe group project is the bulk of the work in the class, and the deadlines were generally fairly set to space out the stages of design work you need to do. I don't remember the feedback from the professor or TA being insanely helpful, but they were always available during class work sessions to answer any specific questions you had.\r\n\r\nWhen I took the class, there was one midterm exam, but it was open book and pretty easy since most of the questions came directly from the textbook. There were reading homeworks that included a few simple questions to answer about the readings, so if you did them, you would recognize on the exam which sections to look for, and even if you didn't remember the readings, it was simple to search the textbook and find the answers you needed. The readings were never too hard and talked a lot about the details of the human-centered design process, and the lectures were good at reinforcing the reading material and introducing real world applications\/examples.\r\n\r\nAlso the professor goes by Scott Gilkeson, so you will probably find more information about him by searching that name.","762":"Was thinking this would be a fun course to take during my last semester as the thought of working on 1 single large project sounded fun, I was wrong. Lectures are very clear, everything else isn't really much so. \r\nThe course has very vague descriptions of what was to be expected of the student and when grades are released, there is generally no explanation as to why points were removed. You end up not being to fight for points back since there no rubric. You essentially either did what he wanted or didn't, but he didn't tell you, so hopefully you guessed right. The assignments are graded based off personal bias and any attempts to put a creative twist leads to point reduction. I don't understand how a interface design class could be so close minded. Concepts can be applied in different ways. Considering all the concepts taught from lecture, he really need to redesign the course project and assignment descriptions and grading system as I'd rate them as a level 4 on severity because their catastrophic problems. I don't dislike Golub as a person, I however do dislike him as a professor. ","763":"The class is basically one big group project. One of my group members dropped the class, but I don't think he took that into account. Some of the others said it best. His assignment descriptions can be wordy and vague making it hard to figure out what EXACTLY needs to be included for a good grade. The class just felt frustrating overall","764":"Lectures are pointless, avoid this class if you wanted an easy CMSC course, the professor turns what should have been an easy class into a very frustrating experiance.","765":"Very great professor. In my top 5 for sure. I find his lectures engaging and entertaining. Just make sure you get a good group for the semester-long project. If you get a group that will actually do their work, this is a very easy class.","766":"He is horrible Professor, his grading is based on his opinion. He is a complete d*** and doesn't listen to reason. He has no business teaching and has destroyed my GPA.\r\n\r\nSTAY FAR AWAY!!!!!","767":"I took this course in Spring 2021\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n+ The inclusion of three midterms and a final in this course means that, even if your group is not doing well, you still have chances to increase your individual grade\r\n+ For each exam, Golub provides a list of relevant topics along with practice questions to help prepare\r\n+ Golub himself is very knowledgable about HCI, and is more than happy to answer any question regarding it\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- The inclusion of three midterms and a final in this course means that this course is probably significantly more work than you are anticipating\r\n- The course is largely based off of a group project, so if you don't like your randomly assigned group, good luck lol\r\n- Lectures are largely pointless, technical concepts are not important until exam time\r\n- For the group project of designing an app, the help provided by Golub and the TAs is largely design based. If your team is having technical roadblocks, they are, frankly, of little help. \r\n- Especially if you're having technical issues, the timeframe to create the actual technical application can very much feel like not enough time","768":"One of the most useless classes I ever took at Maryland, and Purtilo was mostly responsible for that. I learned almost nothing from this class, because, duh, he doesn't teach at all. Most of the class time is spent either meeting with your teams for the class project (will get to it in a sec). And even when he lectures, the topics are lamest and most useless. \"Change is inevitable,\" he will say multiple times during the lectures. And that's about all you will get from this class (but didn't you already know that).\r\nNow about the class project. One of the most horribly designed software I have ever seen in my life -- Terpnav. The thing (hard to call it a software) has 10 different languages supporting it, is spread over multiple machines with source code that has no documentation, and even Purtilo doesn't know how to install and run the thing. But he persists with it every semester, makes students add features to it, which is not hard in itself, but dealing with this beast of a software is the most annoying part, and yet not worth it at all. And the final is a take-home, which is entirely based on the TerpNav project. So, almost all your grade comes from the class project. He will say in the beginning there will be smaller projects too (we had just one), but essentially what you do with TerpNav is all that accounts for your grade.\r\nTake this class with anyone but Purtilo. I have heard some other professors do much better job.","769":"A very chill, relaxed professor, Memon has a laisez faire approach to teaching. The project is on you and in order to do well you have to stay motivated, attend class, and work effectively in your team. The exams are really easy and the quizzes are fairly simple if you study. I greatly enjoyed this class, but at times I felt that Memon could be more straightforward and helpful by providing more information about certain topics. He would usually answer any student questions by addressing the entire class and relying on other members of the class, but this may be because he is promoting a do-it-yourself attitude for software engineering. I learned a lot about subversioning systems, teamwork, and the software engineering process that has been very useful in my career. Great professor, I would definitely recommend him.","770":"Great professor and very reasonable. He even gives extra points for completing projects early. Highly recommend taking his courses.","771":"The most unorganized and effortless professor I have ever met. Pop quizzes in the first 5 minute of the class, if you are a bit late then f u. Every project is group project. Does not teach coding\/programming\/any comp sci technical knowledge AT ALL. The course is him saying \"hey I want this cool software and you guys have 8 weeks to make it\".","772":"DON'T TAKE HIS CLASS. I didn't write comments at all here. But I am writing this 3800 words final and I got to alert you guys. His lecture is unorganized, he tests you things on his slides but he never uploaded his slides and recordings. What you did is a big group project which is lack instruction, all you do is to figure out how to start from zero to 100 by yourself.  I paid way more time than in this project than in other classes. After demo, presentation, documentation writing. You also need to write a final (which is like a 4000 words reports to him) reflect your effort on this project.","773":"doesn\u2019t teach, and gives no directions for all his work then proceeds to be very unfair with grading ethics ","774":"I went into the class very optimistic. Purtilo seemed like a nice guy. Little did I know the absolute piece of human debris this so-called man actually embodied. I took this class in my final semester. On the first quiz, the SYLLABUS quiz, he falsely accused me of cheating. Rather than talking to me about it, he went straight to the University. This could have completely derailed my reputation and ability to graduate on time. I was found innocent because thankfully the other accused party admitted to cheating off of ME on the quiz. From that point on, it seemed this \"teacher\" had it out for me. His teaching style is horrific. He is, as the kids say, a donkey-hole. He did not teach a single substantive thing the entire year besides common sense work habits and practices. No technical skills taught whatsoever. He makes everyone keep GRADED journal entries of their class-related activities, but only accepts the journal entries to be given on his own personal webpage (which half the class did not know existed) (he refused to accept my handwritten journal entries). His grading system for quizzes and projects is completely abstract and holds zero standards. For the final project, which is worth about half your grade, he divided us up into teams, gave each team a different project description, and continued to change the project requirements and give unclear answers of his expectations. He would then blame us (my teammates and I) for the confusion that he orchestrated. I pulled two all-nighters in all of college, both for this final project. My teammates and I worked our donkeys off, and we stayed up until the last waking minute to get everything done correctly. At 11pm the night it is due, he set out an email with a new requirement to all of our surprise: a five page report..... added on to the final project. We submitted the project well into the night, and by 9am, after literlly spending all semester and multiple crazy late nights on this, he had it graded. By 9am. Literally hours after submitted. A large scale coding project, a 20 page paper, and a 5 page report. And he gave us all the same grade (even though he said he would grade on team participation as well). He gave us all an F. BY THE WAY, each team final project was just a personal pet project that he wanted to personally use, and each team's project was entirely different from every other team, which is completely unfair in terms of expectation and grade. He clearly has class favorites (if you are a kiss-donkey and teacher's pet, you get an A, otherwise, you get a C). He pretends to care about your issues in class then in private he scolds you for being \"stupid\" and \"dishonest\". He said in the beginning of the final project that JIRA is encouraged to be used, only to completely disregard all out JIRA entries once submitted and treated it as if we did zero task tracking because \"its on JIRA, that's not the right format\". His class is endless and thankless work, zero gain, useless busy work, and a compete mess. He is hypocritical, confusing, condescending, abusive, degrading, and BY FAR the worst \"teacher\" I have EVER had. Stay the frank away!","775":"Vanhoy is just fantastic in every way. One of the best professors in the CS department, no doubt about it. I found his teaching style to be very effective. I think this class probably taught me more than any other class I took at UMD. If you intend to go into software engineering, taking CMSC435 with Vanhoy is a must.\r\n\r\nThe class is a lot of work, but it's graded very fairly. For the main project, your group meets with the professor so the exact expectations are set, and as long as you meet those expectations, you can easily get 100 on all parts of the project. And since you get extra credit for turning things in early, it's actually pretty easy to get over 100. My final grade in this class is around 102. Granted, I had to put in a lot of effort and learn a ton of new stuff to get that grade, but it was all definitely worth it. I really can't recommend this class with this professor enough.","776":"The one and only. This was hands down the most useful class that I've taken in this university. I am set to be a software engineer, so if you are in the same boat, this class is *invaluable*. You use Scrum during the group project, which is done in most companies. You also learn about design patterns, refactoring, integrations, Git, and more Agile features. Also, readability counts!\r\nI highly recommend that aspiring software engineers take this class. Take it not necessarily for the grade (although you will easily be able to get an A if you do the work), but rather as preparation for the job itself. You will thank yourself later. ","777":"TAKE THIS CLASS WITH VANHOY.\r\n\r\nThis guy is the GOAT. Even though he records his lectures, I actually went to class. The is one of the most useful classes you'll ever take. You learn how to use git, which honestly should be enough to get you to take this class. You also work in teams over a few projects (teams of 2 and then teams of 4). You work in scrums and agile framework. You learn how to write clean code. When people said that there were too many projects, he gave us a week off and allowed us to redo the previous assignment for full credit. The projects themselves are really easy - the main thing is to learn how to write the clean code and use proper software engineering principles. It made my internship so much easier!","778":"if you were doubting any of the other reviews of this class, i highly suggest you to take this class and see for yourself. thankfully i was able to pick up on all the red flags of this professor that others -- especially the one that wrote the essay -- wrote about myself in class BEFORE the drop period.\r\n\r\n- having class favorites\r\n- says the same common sense stuff every lecture\r\n- unorganized lecture","779":"Please don't take his class at any cost.  First of, for those of you who doesn't know, this class is a capstone class(I didn't know ). This means he doesn't teach you anything. He even tell you that at the beginning of the class. All his task is vague. You don't know what the heck is going on in class. And the project description is as vague as it can get. If the instruction doesn't confuses you, he will find another one that does (I am serious).","780":"A truly wonderful professor. I'd heard mixed stories about CMSC289I beforehand, but Prof. Reggia made this class a great experience. He was always friendly, and very approachable via office hours and email. After every homework, quiz, and exam, Prof. Reggia took great pains to make sure we understood the content before moving onto new topics. Even if people had still trouble understanding the material, Prof. Reggia strongly encouraged students to \"grab me or one of the TAs after class\". \n\r\nThe content itself was great. This class provided a great opportunity to see how broad a field it really is. One definitely doesn't need to be a CS major to get something out of this class.\n\r\nIn short, excellent professor and excellent class. ","781":"One of the best professors I've had in my UMD experience. His slides were easy to understand, and he made sure that everyone understood the content before moving on. For example, he'd give ungraded quizzes from time to time, and always take time afterwards to explain what was going on. The same went for the exams. After each of the midterms, Prof. Reggia took a good chunk out of his lectures to make sure we got the content. Both in lecture and in office hours, he was very friendly and polite; in fact he encouraged us to stop by if we were worried about grades, homework, or a topic not clearly understood from lecture.\n\r\nIf you have a chance to take a course under Prof. Reggia, do it. ","782":"This is from the perspective of a CMSC student.\n\r\nReading the description, I was worried this class wouldn't be as suitable for Computer Science students, but was happily wrong. \r\nThe class does not require mathematical knowledge beyond algebra(logarithms are briefly explained, and provided for you in many cases).\r\nThe class also does not require previous knowledge in computer programming.  While it will be easier to understand some of the concepts with a ComSci baackground, it is in no way required or required to do well.\n\r\nIf you are a Computer science student interested in AI, you will enjoy this class as well.  Many of the concepts, algorithms, and techniques taughts can be used in your other CMSC courses as well as CMSC421 of course.\n\n\r\nThe grade is made up of 20% for homework and quizzes, 20% for each of two midterms, and 40% for the final.  \r\nWe had 9 homework assignments regularly spread out through the semester.  Each homework took roughly a couple hours to complete, and plenty of time was given to complete them.  Part of the homework would be 'randomly' selected and be graded, the rest wouldn't be graded.\r\nThere was 1 quiz early in the semester, then a second quiz that wasn't graded.  \r\nThe two midterms were difficult, not cumulative, but thorough, and resulted in low averages, about 50-60%.\r\nThe final was cumulative and mainly consisted of problems that were already reinforced through homeworks as well as trivia-esque questions.\r\nWhile the averages for some of the homeworks and the midterms were fairly low, there was a very generous curve, and Dr. Reggia revealed an estimate of how the curve would be done based on each of the midterms. Though not estimated in class, the curve also affects the homework and final exam.\n\r\nEssentially, if you finished the homeworks and understood them, paid attention in class and did the readings, you could get an A without it being a high-stress course.\n\r\nAfter every homework, quiz, and midterm, each question was reviewed in depth and Dr. Reggia gave numerous opportunities for students to ask questions.  \n\r\nDr. Reggia is very approachable after class and in office hours.  ","783":"CMSC289I- Horrible class. Worst class I've ever taken at UMD. Was duped into thinking it would be an interested course to fulfill a CORE requirement. Turned out to be the hardest class I've taken at UMD. On top of that there is no discussion so you don't really have an opportunity to make sense of what you cover in class. If your looking for an easy CORE class, THIS IS NOT IT.\n\r\nReggia- Nicest guy ever. Went to him a week before the final breaking down bc I had like a F in the class and he was so comforting, and reassuring. Told me if I got a C on the final he'd give me a C in the class. And I did:)","784":"Professor Foster is extremely responsive to his students. At the beginning of the course, he made it clear that it was his first time teaching the course and that it was being redesigned from the ground up. He was very amenable to giving extensions when the situation warranted, and whenever a problem or difficulty with the project specs was brought up, he would ask the class what fix they thought was appropriate.\n\r\nThe lectures in this class cover a lot of very interesting, oh-that's-how-that-works topics. They were mostly his slides, with a few taken from others' talks, and a few design discussions.\n\r\nThe projects are a lot of fun, but a LOT of work. Do not put them off. They help a huge amount in understanding the material.\n\r\nThe tests were tough, since they required serious knowledge of the topics covered, but we were only expected to have an in-depth understanding of topics that were the focus of lectures. ","785":"Jeff is a great professor, and his classes are well-designed and great. \n\r\nFor 430 (compilers), Jeff totally redesigned the course, and made it incredibly challenging, relevant, and fun. I look back on the work I did in his class and can feel as if I accomplished something meaningful that made me more powerful as a computer scientist.\n\r\nEven if you aren't interested in programming language design (Jeff obviously is, and his enthusiasm for the material is palpable in the class), you should still take 430, because it will enable you to know intimately a tool that every computer scientist uses on a daily basis.","786":"I think this was Gilray's first time teaching CMSC 430, and he did a really good job. The content is quite tough and some projects are very challenging, but Gilray held office hours right after class to answer any questions. If you weren't able to catch him then, he's very active on Piazza and is really knowledgeable on the content. He's also very understanding and knows that his class is tough, and as such he gives out extensions on the projects on a case by case basis. Some of the lectures themselves are very heavy, but Gilray does a good job explaining the material and don't be afraid to ask questions! Overall a great instructor and just a great guy in person.","787":"Down-to-earth and personable guy who really knows his subject. Definitely learned a lot from his class.","788":"Epic twitter account. ","789":"Such a great professor. Clearly is dedicated to the course and the students. He genuinely wants kids to learn and to build a curriculum that is strong and representative. \r\n\r\nHowever 430 was very challenging and a lot of work so beware if you enroll to spend 10-15+ hours on projects. There were no exams though just projects for all assignments, midterms, and final.","790":"honestly the coolest dude i've ever met, really knows his stuff and is super laid back. incredibly accommodating for the whole distance learning thing, too.","791":"He's a great teacher. He takes time to explain the concepts in detail. This course is about compilers and as you'd imagine, the class might cover some low level stuff, which can be confusing. But Jose takes time to break down everything so you can understand. He doesn't overload students with a lot of homework; he gives just the right amount of quizzes and assignments to help understand the material. Projects are mainly an extension of the concepts thought; if you understand his explanations, doing the projects shouldn't be complicated. In terms of availability, he's always willing to extend his office hours to accommodate students. If you really want to learn, take his class.","792":"Jose is super nice and understanding of students concerns and needs. Assignments were super interesting and pretty fair, if you have a good understanding of the course material and Racket. Online class consisted of asynchronous YouTube videos with corresponding lecture notes on the website. Really learned a lot from the class and he was great!","793":"Fantastic professor. Knows his stuff and he clearly cares about making sure the students understand the material and do well in the class.\r\n\r\nFor 430 specifically, we had 6 projects and they each took a fair bit of time (5-7 hours), but over the course of a semester that really isn't so bad. Definitely a reasonable amount of work for the class.\r\n","794":"very chill professor","795":"Such a great professor. Literally so sweet and makes the best  lectures ever. Actually gets me excited to learn about compilers. Lectures are really well put together and fun to watch.","796":"Fall 2020 Semester. MVP. I'm not aware of another professor that makes the material so accessible. ","797":"The course material was very interesting, and the materials provided were very helpful. DVH lectures well, but can be monotone, which can make it difficult to stay focused if you're easily distracted like I am. Outside of lecture, a Discord server was set up for the class. This was massive since it made communication between course staff and students more frequent, casual, and clear. It closed a lot of distance between the two groups. The format of Discord also made it so that problems students had could be solved more smoothly than they would on something like Piazza. DVH is also very kind in general. If he's an option, I'd highly recommend taking him, because he knows how to run a course. ","798":"Without a doubt the best professor I have ever had and one of the most interesting and well put together classes I have ever taken. Jose is the GOAT, there's no other way to put it. He's passionate, kind, considerate, intelligent, funny, and organized. There is no one I would rather take a class with. He has changed the course of my college career.","799":"You would be hard pressed to find a professor with more passion, professionalism, kindness, and genuine care for both their work and their students. Jose deserves 6 stars","800":"Lectures are kinda dry but DVH explains things really well. Instead of Piazza he used Discord to communicate with the class, which made it so much easier to reach him and the TAs.\r\nThe class is not necessarily hard, but it is a lot of busy work. Gotta stay on top of it.","801":"Very interesting, entertaining person, which is why I didn't realize sooner that the class was not going to go anywhere.\r\nWe went over the basics of all topics, but so little that you never really learned more than \"huh, that's interesting\". Projects had no deadlines, and weren't too difficult, except that we had no basis to go off of, and it's just stabs in the dark to try to get something working (still haven't figured it out, even though he tried to help me once that wasn't enough and I'm still completely lost). Take home midterm was a rehash from the grad level class 10 years ago, plus 3 more pages, and way beyond the scope of what we'd learned in class.\r\nI wish I had noticed sooner that this class was worth dropping, because I learned nothing worthy of my tuition money and am very disappointed as I was looking forward to this class.","802":"Good professor, good class. It's not so much about image processing as it is about computer vision, which turns out to be much more interesting. Dr. Jacobs is very familiar with the material and makes it easy to understand.  The coursework is not very hard, but Matlab can be frustrating sometimes. ","803":"His class is in Python, the projects are substantial, try to work in groups. Teli's explanations are pretty match-heavy, and it's easy to drown in the math. But he still gives his best effort to explain concepts.","804":"I took Teli for 351 and really enjoyed his class, but 426 left a lot to be desired. Lectures were hard to follow, and didn't relate much to the content that homeworks and exams required you to understand. The workload was also crazy high - there were 3 homeworks and 4 projects, all of which were very involved from an implementation standpoint. Although grading was fairly lax, getting something that felt like it worked was also very difficult, and it was hard to get an idea of whether your code was working as expected, which I understand is somewhat due to the nature of Computer Vision. On multiple assignments many students spent more than 30 hours trying to complete them. When students brought up these concerns they were largely ignored, and were told to 'work harder'. ","805":"I had Metzler for 426 and thought the class was fine. The lectures were boring and could be confusing at times. Since there are no exams, the grades are fully dependent on the homeworks and projects. I would only recommend this class if you are pretty good with linear algebra and are willing to commit a decent amount of time for projects. ","806":"Lectures were pretty dry--though that was to be expected. Content was very linear algebra heavy (a personal weak point), but we were warned of this ahead of time and given a small primer prior to class. Class was totally project-based and professor Metzler and the TAs were quick to assist on piazza. Ample extra credit was given as well. The class could certainly better--most classes could--but I thought professor Metzler handled it pretty well, particularly for his first semester at UMD. This content seemed particularly difficult to relay in an online environment, so I often found myself skipping lectures to watch the recordings later in order to pause and take notes. ","807":"Awesome professor. Professor was very helpful throughout the course on piazza, and the lecture slides were clear and concise. Facilitated smooth learning. Additional learning links were provided for reference. Projects had clear expectations with them, fixed rubric. Easy A class. ","808":"He does not cover anything that the course requires. He is arguably one of the worst professors I have ever had. ","809":"To be honest, I've had alot of different teachers and taking this class is just not it. Expect to learn everything by yourself.","810":"The class is quite interesting, but if you've taken CMSC422 there is a lot of repeated information, which led to a lot of boredom for me. Not his fault though, I just barely recommend this class if you've taken CMSC422. He also does derivations sometimes for some reason even though they never show up in the homework or exams.\r\n\r\nThe biggest gripe I have is he only released rubrics for homework past the halfway point in the semester. You need those rubrics.","811":"Great professor if you are there to actually learn real concepts and not just trying to memorize some text book. Like one of the best educational experiences I've had in all my years at UMD. He is the reason I persued a Combined BS\/MS degree and was a great guy to work with.","812":"Lectures are great for learning concepts, clearly has a ton of knowledge and is passionate and kind. For the projects most of the learning has come from TA led overviews\/course notes for projects also written by TAs. Projects done in groups of 3-4 and are challenging but I personally feel they are rewarding. Midterm was fairly tough but according to the TAs it will be curved fairly well. Would recommend for anyone with a passion for learning or interest in these topics, would recommend starting projects early with your group.","813":"I give Dr. Katz a 4 out of 5 because, all things considered, he was a pretty good professor in a lot of ways.\n\r\nFirst of all, his lectures and the content of the course follow his textbook almost to the letter so you have something concrete that you can use to follow along with the course. That being said, I found the book to be a bit dry and ambiguous at certain points (especially the 3rd chapter) and it definitely took a lot of getting used to. Still, it's a pretty solid book (especially considering that it's the first proof based undergrad crypto textbook on the market) and Katz does a good job of following the content well.\n\r\nAnother of Katz's strengths is that he's VERY open to taking questions and will elegantly field even the dumbest possible questions you could ever imagine. In all seriousness though, he's always willing to take questions and clarify points. Given that crypto is a pretty comprehensive and complex subject this is very important and very helpful.\n\r\nNow for (what I thought were) the not-so-good aspects of Katz's teaching style. For one thing, I personally found  that the way he communicated just wasn't very easy to learn from. It wasn't just that the course was hard either -- I found that even when Katz lectured on stuff that I already knew that the message he was trying to get across was vague and difficult to wrap one's head around. It's hard to explain -- that's just how I felt about his teaching style.\n\r\nAlso, I felt that his homeworks were a huge pain and didn't really help very much to get across the content of the course. Most of the questions were taken from the exercises in the book and they took FOREVER and were graded pretty (to be frank, VERY) harshly by the TA.\n\r\nOverall, I recommend Katz for CMSC\/MATH 456. I personally don't think he's the best lecturer out there but I learned a ton in his class and I know for a fact that you're going to learn a LOT more from him than you are from Fitzgerald or the other math crypto professor.","814":"Professor: Seems like a great guy. He does his lectures on a whiteboard and doesn't post any notes online. As a whole his lectures are good and worth going too. He likes answering questions and will schedule a meeting with you if you need extra help (and ask for it). \n\r\nCoursework: We only had homework, the midterm, and the final. The homework's are challenging, are graded hard, and are a big part of your grade. I would recommend trying to team up with another person in class to work on them or to stop by the TA's office hours (I did neither). The midterm and the final were medium difficulty. He doesn't give any practice tests to study, so study the book and the book problems...hard.    \n\r\nGrades: He does some kinda of curve with the homework's, not sure what. The midterm and the final cut offs might be changed depending on how the class did overall. No extra work or credit will be given, so study hard for the midterm and the final. If you do badly on either, you have a good chance of failing the class.   \n\r\nBottom Line? Don't underestimate the homework's or the tests and you can do well in this class. My C grade was due to a poor midterm grade and some of my poor homework grades. This is a great senior class because of the low workload (homework's are spaced around with one to two weeks breaks in between, and you only have two tests). But don't take this class if your the type that does badly on tests.","815":"He's alright, I suppose.  \n\r\nThere were \r\n- 11 homeworks worth a total of 20%. He dropped the lowest one. \r\n- 2 midterms worth 20% each \r\n- The final exam was worth 35%. \r\n- 2 simple online quizzes on Elms worth a total of 5%.\r\nAll the grades were kept up to date on Elms, which is nice.\n\r\nI did go to lectures and took notes most of the time, but I felt like I took notes just for the sake of it. I never really looked over them, because I felt he was just reiterating what was in the book sometimes. He did do examples though. One lecture I realized he was introducing something we had just done for homework as if he wasn't aware of the homework at all. I suppose a TA grades it. \n\r\nThe homework was kind of easy, with a few problems requiring Matlab. He had the useful M files on Elms. I learned mostly from the book and Google...\n\r\nThe only issue was his exams. The questions were pretty tricky. None of them were really similar to any homework or previous exam. You had know the topics pretty well and even then you had to think pretty hard for a bit to try and work out some of these problems. I felt some of them were riddles really. Another thing is there were a lot of topics and cryptosystems to study for... a lot of tricky modular arithmetic and number theory involving factoring, Fermat, primality, and whatnot. \n\r\nThe final was pretty nasty. I felt like I had pretty much failed the course after time was up. It was 200 points. There were only about 20, maybe 30 points worth of problems I felt confident about. The class average for it was 108 (out of 200). \n\r\nI guess it's okay though because apparently no one got below C- with overall final scores ranging from 43% to 90%, an average of 67, and a standard deviation of 12.8 for 27 students. So it's a huge curve for this class at least. It's quite a relief because I needed this to graduate. \n\r\nIt's weird because I was really wondering. A few people almost never showed up to class, and I think this one guy only showed up for the exams. ","816":"He seems nice and caring.\n\r\nBut don't expect him to be nice on grade. He will fail you regardless of what situation you are in...even if it's your last semester ever, he will make you stay.","817":"Very reasonable guy.  He's very open to questions and dedicates fridays to recapping what he over the prior week and for student questions (no one takes advantage of this).\n\r\nAs for exams, he is incredibly reasonable.  As long as you attend class regularly, you don't even have to study for the exam.  He focuses more on the general idea more than anything else.  I can't say that I found the course itself too interesting (CMSC414, which I took the same semester, had a section about crypto that basically went over anything I was interested in), but the course was pretty good in conjunction with CMSC414.","818":"He is a good lecturer and is very open to students' questions. The homework is very hard (even if you know the material very well) but the tests are VERY easy. He curves the grades so that the median is somewhere around a C+\/B-.","819":"Does a good job at teaching. He answers any questions about the proofs, theorems, and constructions during lectures. He also references some real world examples outside the course work to keep the class interested. Exams were very easy (20min midterm, 40min final) if you studied the material and did well on the homeworks. Homeworks may be ridiculously difficult at times but the challenges was certainly enjoyed.","820":"Dr. Washington was great and the nicest professor. He was interesting everyday and had his material ready. Unfortunately, he had generally low standards for how much material to cover in the class, and if you really want to take cryptology to know the material at an advanced level, don't take it with him. If you want to take it for fun and to learn a few things about cryptology, take it with him, because you will learn!","821":"Adams was an all around wonderful professor and this class was my favorite of the semester.  It's a tough course, with an estimate 5-10 hours needed per week to master the homework problems and material.  Thankfully, Adams did very well explaining concepts and helping the students through problems.  He's a really nice guy (with a relaxed teaching style) who was very helpful during office hours.  He was also lenient when it came to a late homework once in a while or toward emergencies.  Frankly, he's just a nice guy that loves teaching Cryptology.  There are weekly homework assignments with reasonable due dates and two midterms and a final (no quizzes).  I found the exams tough, but struggled with the material throughout the course.  For some reason, the course material clicked toward the end and I started to see the \"big picture.\"  Adams does a nice curve and does everything he can to make sure everyone passes (i.e. possibly dropping a poor exam grade if you do good on the other one).  \n\r\nTaking number theory (Math 406) is not mandatory for this class as Adams covers the topics from number theory that are needed.  It will obviously put you ahead of the curve if you've taken such a class, but you won't be behind if you didn't.  \n\r\nThis review covers Cmsc 456 and Math 456 as they are the same course.      ","822":"Dr. Washington is an amazing professor!\r\n\r\nHe teaches concepts very clearly, is a super nice guy. He's very understanding about workload and will give you any extensions you need. Exams are very fair, and I had fun putting in what work I could to learn the material (I was also taking cmsc414 and cmsc320 that semester). Definitely take a class with him before you graduate!","823":"He is THE man. Great guy, super funny and he really cares about his students. His homeworks are also fair, challenging but not impossible. He's also good about explaining everything until you understand","824":"Best professor I ever had. Posts Panopto recordings and uploads his notes onto ELMS, very fair exams and not a lot of HW. Such a nice guy as well. 10\/10 recommend","825":"Wouldn't recommend, his lecture slides are terrible for someone trying to learn the course content. I've skipped class the past few weeks now and have been learning the same content from elsewhere online because they are explained in easier terms, without all the confusing notation. His teaching style is fairly decent though, as he speaks clearly and reiterates a lot of the content to try to help you understand.","826":"(spring 2020, ~ second half online due to COVID-19, expecting A\/A+ but also P since I will P\/F all my classes)\r\nI was going to rate 4\/5, but Dr. Manning handled the shift to the online format really well, so 5\/5.\r\nThe first midterm (in-class) was made really easy (mathematically) since a lot of CS majors don't have the sufficient proof-writing experience. Similarly some lectures could be really boring due to the need to explain some math concepts that some CS majors aren't familiar with (e.g. basic linear algebra).\r\nNote that on PlanetTerp (as of writing this) MATH456 has an average GPA of 2.93 while CMSC456 has an average GPA of 2.37 even though they are the same class (only math majors \/ cs+math double majors can register for the class as MATH456).\r\n\r\nAfter the class was shifted online due to COVID-19, Dr. Manning provided recorded videos (much better than forcing students to virtually attend at fixed times) and the second midterm was a ~week-long mix of theoretical questions and programming (implementing some of the algorithms described in the lectures).","827":"i mean, the course content is just hard in general. but i had trouble paying attention in lecture, i mostly self taught from the book, with guidance from the lecture slides. i will admit the lecture slides are good. i took this class during the COVID-19 pandemic and the transition to online learning was very smooth. homeworks can be hard but they aren't like 451 hard, and it's \"possible\" to do it in one day. work with other people...coming up with certain proof ideas can be hard on your own. ","828":"Adams has been super supportive and understanding this semester due to the online format. He made all midterms open note and take home with at least 24 hours to complete each one. For this semester, the final is optional if you're already satisfied with your grade. Adams is also good at stopping for student questions.","829":"Bill G is the GOAT!  He is super friendly and great at teaching the material in a way that is understandable.  Homeworks and exams are sometimes tricky but aren't impossible if you understand the material from class.  We had a handful of guest lectures this semester as a \"break\" from the normal material.  Overall, he's fantastic and I'd take another course with him in a heartbeat.","830":"Course was easy and interesting at the same time, Bill was funny and taught the material in a super understandable way. Would easily take another course with him","831":"Very WEIRD profesor who typos a lot. Not sure why he is a computer science professor when all he does is MATH.\r\n\r\nAfter 5 months he still doesnt know my NAME.\r\n\r\nI am surprised he is alowed to make bets with students.","832":"The grading in this class is significantly harsher than Washington's Cryptography section (class average was 79.5% while Washington historically averages ~87% and we did not get a curve. In addition, Dr. Papamanthou did not hold us back from the mathematical rigor that a cryptography course should have. Homeworks and course content are proof-based and taught rigorously. Having a good understanding of proofs will likely make this course much easier.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I felt like Dr. Papamanthou was a very good professor. He frequently stopped to ask questions in class and carefully answered all of them, trying to make sure everyone understood the material. The course content reflected content in corresponding chapters of the textbook, but his lectures definitely condensed the material and made it more digestible.\r\n\r\nOverall good professor, but I would suggest having a good understanding of proofs before taking this class. In addition, taking MATH406 Number Theory before or alongside this course makes the group theory part of the course much more understandable, in addition to helping you get used to proofs.","833":"This was probably the easiest class I've ever taken. I literally only ever lost 10 points on one homework assignment all year; it is so easy to do super well in this class that I'm not even sure how you review it. I never went to lecture, so I'm not sure how much ill retain if anything, but got an easy A so take that as you may.","834":"Unsurprisingly a great class. Nothing less expected from Justin.\r\n\r\nPros: \r\n+ Outstanding lectures\r\n+ Reasonable homeworks and coding assignments\r\n+ Fair exams\r\n+ Good grade distribution - nothing is too heavily weighted\r\n+ Responsive on Piazza\r\n+ Helpful overview of materials, was an appropriate amount of breadth\r\n\r\nCons (these are really meant to be constructive feedback):\r\n- There were some nontrivial mistakes on homeworks\/notes\/exams, which wasn't the end of the world, but did cost me time while taking the exam\r\n- Some of the Piazza responses could have been more civil\r\n\r\nTake a class with Justin if he's teaching it!","835":"Dr. Katz is pretty good. He is world renowned in cybersecurity and he literally wrote the book (one of them at least). That being said while he does a good job explaining, he does move a bit fast and covers more material than many of the other professors. Whether that is a pro or a con is for you to decide. His exams are a bit on the tough side also. Much of our class did pretty poor on the midterm and final, although only about 1\/4 of the class actually came to lecture, so maybe that factored into it as well. \r\n\r\n The only real gripe I have is that he comes off as a bit rude via email and piazaza. Though in person and in office hours he isn't like this.\r\n\r\nOverall I'd say Dr Katz is a solid choice if you're willing to put in the effort and study the material.","836":"as we all know Justin is a great professor and that was the case with cryptography. definitely learned a lot and he didn't make it harder or easier than it needed to be, which is amazing considering it's his first time teaching the course. as a teacher, there is nothing that I can complain about. there is a fair amount of work but I think it's reasonable for a 400 level course. \r\nI'm giving him 4 stars because I felt there were instances where he was rather curt\/rude when responding on Piazza. maybe that wasn't his intention because he's always very kind in class, but that is how it came across on Piazza. also no recorded lectures which was kind of annoying (i think he just really hates anything to do with online school) but at least he posts his notes from class online.\r\noverall, great in terms of teaching so I would recommend","837":"She is nice and a clear lecturer. She teaches from slides which generally have everything you need to know and does examples on the projector. The exams weren't trivial but were often similar to examples which were heavily emphasized in class.","838":"I'll be adding to this review by the end of the semester with more details, but please anyone who is thinking about signing up for a class with this guy... just DON'T. He teaches at his own pace without worrying about the students, every lecture is basically him going on and on just listening to the sound of his own voice. Students have made multiple Piazza suggestions about how to improve his lectures to be more understandable and he pretty much blatantly ignores them. We have a week to do each homework and when the class was able to solve all the problems on HW3, he was surprised and said that isn't normal, so he'll make sure to increase the difficulty in the future HWs this semester ??. To prepare for our midterm he won't give us answers to practice questions and his advice is to \"read the textbook\" to prepare for the exam. Especially if you are a CS major this guy is not for you, he teaches class like he has never heard of computer science and only cares about math and physics concepts.","839":"This teacher is extremely poor at teaching.","840":"This guy teaches undergrads as if they were PhD students. He has no clue what he\u2019s doing. This guy will spend 80% of review for midterm going over something that won\u2019t be on the midterm, but when we ask for examples of problems we need to be able to do, that\u2019s \u201cnot a good use of class time\u201d. He won\u2019t even use the doc cams because he personally doesn\u2019t like them. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this clown.","841":"The reviews posted by other people are honestly very disrespectful. This class is definitley very challenging, but these personal attacks are honestly ridiculous. Not fair at all to call your professor a 'clown' or whatever. As one of many hoping for a curve in this class, maybe blatant disrespect aint the way to go.","842":"Read all the posts below. She is fun, knowledgeable, cares about her students, and works with you if you don't understand certain concepts.\n\r\nHer teaching style isn't for everyone, but I find you can extrapolate your compatibility with her from the prior reviews.\n\r\nBottom line is: SHE CARES. She wants you to succeed and she'll fight tooth and nail for her students.\n\r\nThis review isn't nearly as long or as passionate as it should be, but I think the others get it across nicely.","843":"You will not learn anything by taking this class. Past exams saved my life. ","844":"Not a great lecturer. Too little resource to prepare for the exam. Get ready to teach yourself if you are about to take this professor's class.","845":"Pretty tough class if you don't understand. Exams are hard, there were not enough materials given to practice. He is understanding but not good as a lecturer.","846":"Dr. Yoon's delightful attitude towards student concerns was not enough to fully recommend him as a lecturer. This course is pretty dry and dull in terms of material, so I am not sure if any other teacher would've made it more interesting for me, but Dr. Yoon certainly did not.\r\n\r\nI took this course during a summer session so it was compacted into classes every day for 6 weeks. We had one midterm exam, a home work every week and a final exam. I felt so inadequately prepared for both exams, and the homeworks were tedious busy work. On top of that he assigned a coding project in C that was a simulation of the MIPS pipeline process (You learn about this during the class) and it was the second hardest project I ever took on and I felt it was just useless busy work. \r\n\r\nThe midterm was incredibly long and ridiculously packed with material not many were familiar with. He even said he anticipated low exam scores because people would not finish on time. For the first exam, we originally had 85 minutes, however since there was no class after ours let out he extended it to 100 minutes because people needed more time. This was the same situation for the final exam only no time extension. I barely got time to go to all the questions and just attempt them. \r\n\r\nThe one thing that makes this class with Yoon worth it, is it can be a passable class since he gives a butt load of extra credit and partial credit for just attempting questions but not necessarily answering them correctly.\r\n\r\nBecause of the unreasonable amount of questions on exams, the difficulty of the project and homeworks, the average of the class was a 56%. So Yoon curved the course NICELY. I ended up with a 66% and that was good enough for a B- .\r\n\r\nI like Yoon as a person and he's very helpful in his office hours but he still isn't very clear on the material a lot of times. Since I do not know how the other teachers are for 411 I cannot suggest taking them over Yoon. If you have to take Yoon just remember these things 1) The exams are unreasonably long and nearly impossible to get an A on, but he gives a lot of partial credit for simply attempting questions. 2) The project he assigns is hard and unnecessary busy work. 3) He isn't very effective as a lecturer, and does not give enough resources and practice materials to prepare you for exams. Even homeworks are not sufficient.","847":"One of the worst professors I've had. He is a terrible lecturer - anything he says goes in one ear and out the other. He gives extra credit and partial credit - but you don't learn anything in his class. If you actually want to learn something, I recommend taking another teacher.","848":"Perfect professor to take if you want to simply pass the class. I studied 3 days before both midterms and did perfectly fine. The exams are very long and you aren't expected to finish them. However, you should attempt to write something for every single question because you will get partial credit as long as it's not blank. The class is online now so you are given a ton of readings\/videos and one homework to turn in each week. I never read any articles or watched any videos. The homeworks are graded for completion and are worth 5% of your grade. To study, simply read over the answers to the homeworks. As long as you know a little bit of the material, you should be completely fine. To pass, you need a 55%, which is incredibly easy to achieve. ","849":"Meesh is not a teacher. Meesh is a course coordinator. She sends students on a scavenger hunt looking for course material and then expects them to complete massive exam packets as if we learned enough from her to be able to complete even a portion of them. Instead of providing recorded lectures or even lecture notes, she links to other professors' lectures (I don't think she got permission), and random articles that are completely irrelevant to the questions she asks on examinations. She is very lazy and refuses to answer small questions because she answered them before, and you have to find them on her out of date ELMS pages. When I asked her a question about how things were being handled due to the move online (COVID-19), she gave an extremely rude response, giving the excuse that these things should be obvious when they are clearly not. Just the worst experience I have ever had in a class at Maryland. In fact its not a class, its paying close to 2000$ for the right to take exams. ","850":"Meesh is an enigma. This was the first semester that 411 was fully taught online. We weren't able to learn anything in the first week of classes because she didn't know how to hyperlink her files in ELMS. All Piazza questions were answered vaguely and in long mistyped formats that usually included her having conversations with herself before arriving at an \"answer\" which was usually copied and pasted from the syllabus (which was also confusing and vague). She had weekly worksheet assignments that you would submit on Gradescope. All her weekly \"lectures\" were readings from the book and YouTube videos. She never actually lectured or recorded herself lecturing and when students asked about this and if she could lecture she would respond with a very long and confusing post ultimately saying that she didn't think it was necessary and we should use our skills as students to use our resources (YouTube) to teach ourselves. \r\n\r\nIf you actually watch the YouTube videos, you will learn something. I found it interesting and actually learned a bit but there was no real use for it as the exams were almost copy and paste from her practice exam and the weekly worksheets. However, you won't have enough time to finish the exams because they are 30 pages long. She doesn't expect anyone to finish the exam and grades it based on the highest score. She also drops an exam including the final. You won't fail this class, but you might not learn from it and more than likely will be confused and get a headache if you actually have questions for her. I spent a solid 4 weeks not knowing what was going on and I'm pretty sure she didn't know what was going on either.","851":"Pros:\r\n* prof answers questions on piazza\r\n* prof provides good practice problems\r\n* easy to get an A in the class (or at least very difficult to fail) because there's five different grading methods (your final grade in the class is max of all five possible final grades) and you will get at least one point for each question that is answered on an exam (ie you can only get a zero for a question if you leave it completely blank).\r\n* class is curved\r\n\r\nCon:\r\n* in lieu of lectures, the prof provides several links to mostly relevant material so this course is purely self-taught","852":"I thought CMSC351 with Kruskal was the worst class at UMD, but CMSC411 with Yoon over Summer makes a close second or possibly #1. The way the class is taught, organized and graded is a joke and I learned nothing because of this professor's teaching style. \r\n\r\nThe syllabus describes having up to 5 homeworks with NO due date. We ended up with 4 homeworks released randomly during the semester, one of which was released the last week of class  with 3 days notice - Mean. The class project also did NOT have a release date or due date on the syllabus and it takes half the semester to get even a few points (most of the class couldn't score more than 50% on the project). How are we supposed to plan for a semester with NO DUE DATES????\r\n\r\nFinals week was unnecessarily stressful. Last homework was due, the month-long project was due, and the final exam were due all one day after another. My mental health took such a hit with this bombardment of assignments and inadequate teaching from lectures that I couldn't study for the final at all. Somehow if you just write something down you get partial credit? But did I learn anything? Absolutely not. \r\n\r\nThe only way I passed was because the class had an average of 59% +\/- 20%. Nobody had a clue what their grade was going into finals week. I somehow passed but I honestly did not care if I failed, this class was garbage and I feel it took more out of me than what it offered. I wish I had seen a review like this that would have made me change my 4-year plan to avoid this garbage, but at least I can graduate a semester sooner. \r\n\r\n","853":"She is not a teacher but a photocopier, or this class should be \"How to use search engines\" but not \"Computer Systems Architecture\". She just gives out tons of youtube links and that will be the class. No lecture! You have no idea what the test will be on. We post a poll on piazza and 95% of students agree that the class material is not enough to take the test. IF you are good at GOOGLE, then choose her!","854":"Don't take this class unless your a fan of 20 page exams full of poorly taught information that take literal days to complete.","855":"Meesh is an awful teacher. I went in knowing that the class was at least a little disorganized, but it was beyond that. Grading was slow, the tests (6 of them) were all about 20 pages long and take home over three days, and the questions were always somewhere between confusing and trivia. Course materials weren't much better, and piazza responses to fair questions were rude, if they were answered at all. I don't recommend you take any class with Meesh. ","856":"We took a poll on piazza:\r\nDo you feel that the class materials adequately prepare you for the exams? \r\nOut of the 75 votes, 95% said No and 5% said Yes.\r\nWe then asked for some instructor commentary on the post after it closed. \r\nIt has been 1 month now and we still have not received a response.","857":"This is the first time that 411 was taught fully online from start to finish and..... It was not a fun time at all. Friends of mine said this was a relatively easy class because you just go to lecture and take the 2 exams. But this class is online. From the beginning, Dr.Hugue posts weekly short worksheets with the answers, youtube videos by another professor at a different university, 5-10 pages from the textbook that won't help you on the exam at all, quizzes that are very vague and don't really cover the material on the exam, and with a cherry on top, doesn't lecture at all. Within the first week many students including myself had asked her how we were supposed to study for the exams, and many students including myself either were told to look at the given course material, or never received a response. There were 6 \"short tests\" (In reality they were 6 part tests with 1 being 20 multiple choice questions and the other 5 were 8-15 open response questions with a sentence or more each). She only grades the 5 highest tests too. I will at least say that the course material does help you to answer 3-5 questions on the exam. But that leaves pretty much 90% of the exam to be answered by googling questions for 8-12 hours in order to get a B on each test. I have to assume that if she would just hold lectures that it wouldn't be this bad, but since she either doesn't know how to do remote lectures or make lecture videos, your pretty much left to google all the answers for the tests. On the bright side you can pass the class with a 55% because that is her cut off for a C-.","858":"The absolute worst professor I have ever had for any course. Unbearably long exams, horrible communication skills with her students, questions on exams that make no sense, \"short\" semester exams being 22 pages (we had 6 exams). She is not a professor. She simply writes exams and grades them, that is it. The TAs do nothing, she does not lecture, and she is rude as hell in piazza responses. Avoid her and this class. Take it if you want an easy A, though it may cost you your sanity","859":"Do not ever take a class with her if you value your time or sanity even the slightest bit. I would say \"this is by far the worst professor I have ever had,\" but she doesn't really even qualify as a \"professor\" in any real sense of the word. There's no lecture, and she gives 30-page exams based on material she never taught, riddled with typos and logic errors because they are never proofread, usually with massive sections plagiarized from other courses at other universities. The exams take hours to complete, if you want an A then be prepared to spend well over 80 hours doing independent research to complete them through the semester. Also be prepared to be yelled at if you ask a reasonable question on Piazza, if she deigns to answer at all.","860":"She is not good at all. Like please, don't take her if you don't have to. You will not learn much at all. My knowledge of comp arch is very scattered because of this \"self teaching\" approach, and with no real structured lectures or anything it makes it hard since there's a lot of seemingly conflicting information. Speaking of conflicting information, her notes\/worksheet answers are just straight up incorrect sometimes. \r\n\r\nOverall, a very disorganized course, and if you want to learn something you should probably take it with a different professor. I don't really know why she still teaches. ","861":"If you want to waste your time doing a bunch of 15+ page exams filled with typos, this is your professor. ","862":"6 exams, each like 20 pages, no lectures (actually zero), just YouTube videos and stolen slides. ","863":"This course should have been foundational to my computer science learning but the way the course was executed was below average. The grading policy was changed from the syllabus after the she discovered the one on the syllabus was not an accurate reflection of our scores (it would curve us down). Worksheets used for learning had answer keys with several mistakes. There were no concrete course materials to rely on as each week we were sent links (some of which didn't work) and those links did not help very much with the worksheets or tests. I'd say we were actually taught nothing through this course and that the process of doing the exams (which were open note and internet) was the only way a student could learn and students would have to google their own resources because the given class resources were hardly helpful aside from SOME of the worksheet answer keys (which as I mentioned earlier were poorly explained examples and contained several inaccuracies). Her responses to genuine questions on piazza were rather defensive which made many students not want to ask her questions. The tests determined 90% of our grades were so long-- I spent over 24 hours working on the last test and at least 12 hours on all the other ones (there were 6 short tests that were all 12+ pages). I guess I could summarize the course in that it wasn't necessarily hard but it required students to go far above what they needed to. It felt like she was not the professor of this course and that we did not have a professor at all. ","864":" This semester we had 6 \"short\" exams that ranged from 12-22 pages long each.  Class materials were given to us via youtube links.  She also was too lazy to fix mistakes in the exams and material she gave us.  Overall, not too hard to get a good grade, but the tests do take a considerable amount of time.","865":"Terrible. I don't care that I got a decent grade. What's the point if I did not learn anything? I don't even know what Prof. Hugue looks or even sounds like. All of the class materials uploaded for the course were from a Youtube Channel \"Prof. Dr. Ben H. Juurlink\" or random websites that contained somewhat \"relevant\" information.   Even the slides she uploads are not hers! The \"short\" semester tests are anything but short -- the tests got progressively longer, starting from 12 pages to 23 pages (really?!). Would never recommend this class to anyone that wants to actually learn something. ","866":"Completely fails to teach anything- uses other universities lecture slides and gives exam questions which have nothing to do with the provided notes. ","867":"Complete joke of a class. There are no lectures, just links to youtube videos from other random sources online. There is no communication with students. The tests are painfully long and the questions are sometimes pure nonsense. They are also filled with typos (including due dates because they are copied and pasted from previous semesters) that won't be addressed for days if at all. Anyone on here giving above a 1 star is just happy to pass the class with minimal effort, but as someone who also wanted to learn a little bit this was a complete waste of my time and tuition. I was warned all of this before taking the class but ignored it all because I wanted an easy passing grade, and here I am writing the only review I have ever felt the need to write. If you want to learn computer architecture I recommend doing it on your own, you will be much more successful that way.","868":"Taking this class with Meesh was an incredibly disappointing experience. I knew going in that it wasn't supposed to be a hard class and that it could be a bit disorganized, and those things are both fair enough. This class had a LOT of work - six exams, of which only one was dropped, which gave an exam pretty much every other week. Each of them were about 20 pages, and finding the information was difficult. Grading took forever as well, so it was hard to know how you were doing in the course.  ","869":"Worst professor I've ever had. She literally doesn't teach at all!!! If you have any thoughts of taking a class with her, you should look at the tons of 1 star reviews below this to show how terrible of an instructor she was. DO NOT TAKE HER.","870":"Horrible. Absolutely horrible. No idea how the department still has her on staff, given the abysmal experiences in her classes. ","871":"Avoid taking this course with Meesh at all costs. You won't learn a single thing and you will waste your precious time doing 20+ page long exams multiple times per month. Even Yoon is a better option than this professor. Stay clear! Not taking 411 at all is better than 411 with Meesh. ","872":"I have put my blood, sweat, and tears into this class. Every week, I open my legal textbook PDF and read a good 30 pages of it in addition to watching Ilchuls absolutely disorganized, unintelligible, garbled lectures. We have a lovely 5 quizzes, 5 homework assignments, 2 midterms, and a programming assignment that seem to be on things that Ilchul has never spoken of during lectures. Luckily, he sometimes gives practice material that sometimes helps you prepare for midterms\/quizzes. When I think about this class, I feel like 50lbs of burning coal have amassed onto my chest. That being said, Ilchul is extremely clever; he will always give us quizzes\/midterms that are impossible to finish, but then give a brief apology and swear a soon-to-be reneged promise to make the next quiz\/midterm more fair and doable.\r\n","873":"While I'd give Yoon a 3\/5, all these 1-star ratings are just silly. There are only a few key ideas that you need to know that will get you a B\/C on assignments, which will likely get curved up to an A\/B anyways. People who overstress about trying to memorize endless pages and slides of material aren't approaching the course (and school) in the right way.","874":"Nice guy, but a terrible teacher. The class is terribly structured, and the TAs are not helpful. I feel like I barely learned anything from this class.","875":"I should preface this review by saying that not only did I take CMSC411 with Yoon, but I also took CMSC216 and CMSC131 with him. I was left with a sour taste in my mouth after 131 and 216. The common theme with all three of these experiences is that he is a subpar lecturer and his exams are hard. He very much adopts the philosophy of making exams harder than they need to be in hopes of students having a more thorough understanding of course material as a result. In 216, I completely disregarded his lectures and managed to pass the class solely through self-study of the recommended textbook. I anticipated that I would adopt a similar strategy for CMSC411, but it actually turned out to be the opposite. In 411, I learned practically all of the course material through lecture slides and their accompanying lectures. Reading the textbook isn't really necessary, but it is a useful second resource. I watched every recorded lecture and I was able to understand most of it, and it was not entirely because of the lecture slides. Yoon's lecturing was useful in understanding a lot of the complexities of computer architecture that I likely would have been lost on if I relied solely on the textbook (the textbook is far from an easy read), but the lectures were not easy to get through. The material for this course can be extremely boring at times. The project for this course is not to be taken lightly; absolutely start it as soon as possible. Class final grade average was ~62 and the cutoff to pass the course was basically a 50. Overall, I do feel like I learned a lot but it's not likely to be needed on a day-to-day basis so I will probably forget 90% of it. Yoon is quick to respond to piazza posts, punctual and courteous, but not the best lecturer.","876":"If you are trying to take any class with this prof, you are making the biggest mistake of your life. To simply put it, \r\n1: you waste your time  2: you waste your money(tuition)  3: you learn nothing whatsoever \r\n4: you will stress out trying to do a 20-page long exam(6 of them) without being thought anything.  \r\n\r\nComputer architecture(CMSC411) is good for computer science students, however, if it comes to taking it with this professor, you are better of noting taking this course. \r\nTHE WORST PROFESSOR EVER EXISTED.   ","877":"Life was made difficult and inconvenient by the 20-page examinations issued over the course of the semester. Resources were lacking and the professor would post videos that were sometimes not even in English. You think the class is synchronous as it is listed like that, well think again its asynchronous, does not have actual lectures just bootlegged youtube videos. You won't learn, you'll probably pass though.","878":"He's clearly knowledgeable, but the class structuring is abysmal, and there are questions on exams that he does not prepare you for. \r\n\r\nThere is also this project that is not that hard and boils down to busy work. \r\n\r\nOverall, I'd say what I learned what pretty useless if I end up remembering it at all, and I would recommend you take a different course if you're trying to fill out your area 1 requirement.","879":"Pros:\r\n- Dr. Yoon is very nice person\r\n- Will answer your question in class... probably because only 10 other people came to class\r\n- The 1 programming had better documentation and public tests than most other projects I have seen in CMSC upper levels\r\nCons:\r\n- The class is based around curving. It's more stressful than it has to be\r\n- Exams and quizzes are stupid long; you will not finish\r\n- Exams are only tangentially related to practice problems and homeworks\r\n- Lectures are hard to follow and go by too fast. Dr. Yoon has a hard time of gauging when the class doesn't understands a concept he is explaining and will abruptly move on\r\n- Asking questions about the homework on Piazza is met with vague answers\r\n\r\nWill you die if you take this class? No.\r\nWill it be more difficult than it has to be? Yes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","880":"You do not need to attend his lectures. If you read the book you'll probably be fine. MAKE SURE TO WRITE SOMETHING REASONABLE DOWN FOR EVERY QUESTION ON HIS EXAMS. They are pretty generous with partial credit and will reward you for having some understanding of the material. Lectures were alright but I think the book was more useful. Class avg was like a 62 so just try to get around the average and you'll be fine.","881":"This is the first semester she's teaching I believe, and she's honestly doing a pretty great job in comparison to some of the current cs professors. She definitely knows her stuff and is very willing to help students, so if you asked her questions she's very helpful. She gives you plenty of time to do the homework and projects (about 1 month). There was some struggle to do the homework at first, but everyone asked a lot of questions on piazza, and like I said, she's very willing to help and in the end I was able to do everything. Her homework, practice problems, and lectures definitely help prepare you for the midterm. \r\n\r\nShe does trip up on her words a bit when lecturing so I sometimes struggle to understand, but I think it's just from her first time teaching and it'll get better with experience. I would DEFINITELY RECOMMEND taking her!!","882":"Dr. Asgari teaches this class completely different than how Yoon taught it so put all of that out of your mind. She's a nice person, and competent professor who genuinely wants her students to succeed (and isn't afraid to show it). Don't get me wrong, this class is not an easy A but the exams, projects, and homeworks are all very fair and doable. Her office hours are a valuable resource to get additional clarification and she'll also put practice problems on the course page that are also helpful in understanding the lecture content. Again, this class is difficult but there's less suffering with her as the professor.  I HIGHLY recommend taking a course taught by Dr. Asgari!","883":"I'm extremely glad I took her class this semester. Ever since the beginning of the semester, she has been extremely pleasant and accommodating. All of her assignments are organized and if anything is unclear, she will gladly make things clear on Piazza or during office hours. Her exams in particular actually relate to provided material prior especially because she provides necessary examples to help us practice and understand concepts better. PICK HER CLASS!","884":"She is a new professor and I heard a lot of bad reviews about this course with Joon and Mesh so I was like lets give this a chance. Her class is very organized and homework and projects are doable. She also gives out practice problems to help with the homework, projects and exams. Exam is fair bc some of the questions looks like the practice problems and homework. So if you do the homework and the practice problems you will be fine. She is willing to answer any question you have and make sure that you understand. She really makes this course less painful.","885":"Meesh... I have no idea how I feel about her as a professor and whether or not I recommend her for 420. \n\r\nPros\r\n- You may not have to attend a single class besides exams\r\n- She gives out project extensions always\r\n- She genuinely cares about her students and about you succeeding\r\n- The exams are really fair - since they cover a lot of material you are bound to do well unless you don't know anything at all\r\n- She calculates your grade a bunch of different ways and picks the best one\r\n- If you do well on the first two parts of the project and both midterms you can skip the third part of the project as well as the final and still get  a good grade\n\r\nCons\r\n- The project is pretty hard and time consuming\r\n- You won't learn that much from going to lectures due to her ADD\/Dislexia. Wish she recorded her lectures because she actually is really good at it when she's lecturing and not telling stories\r\n- You won't learn that much about data structures if you take it with her\n\r\nOverall, it depends if you like teaching yourself everything or if you like learning by going to lectures. I prefer the latter and think I may have been happier if I took the course with someone else. I will say that Meesh is an awesome person and with a few small modifications I think she could improve the class. It wasn't necessarily hard but it definitely wasn't easy either. You'll have to put in considerable work (at least on the project) to do well","886":"She is responsible to her students and is always willing to help. The project was ambitious but interesting! Design a Google Map by yourself!","887":"Ok first let me say I am graduating right now and I am currently working for Google and I took Meesh for my CMSC 411(fall 2013) and 420 (summer 2014). On my job interview( for Google) the interviewer asked me about how did i do in Meesh classes? I am just telling that to let you know guys she is really famous. Yea she has ADD and she is talking about her life during the class but trust me all of the material she is covering are going to help you a loooooooot. Yes her Exam are really long and long and long but there are lots of materials that you know about them and you can get points for that. trust me take her class go to the lectures and study the materials she is giving to you!\r\n(Also there are some links like UNIX tutorial which I found it really useful take advantage of those too in your free time.\n\r\nIf you are not working hard and dont try to teach yourself trust me you dont have any place in computer science world ","888":"Lecture: \r\nSo Meesh has ADD and at first you might think \"Why bother coming to lecture since she just goes off on random tangents all the time?\" Well you should go to lecture because:\r\n1) I actually learned a lot during lecture, not sure how, but I learned, the ADD moments might have actually kept me somewhat engaged and \r\n2) the ADD (at least for my semester) seemed to start off terrible and get better as the semester progressed. \n\r\nProjects:\r\nSo you are essentially writing MapQuest (well a low key version anyway). The project is broken into 3 parts and builds on itself throughout the semester. You really need to do well on the first part so that you have a good idea of what is going on, people who slacked on Part I were at a great disadvantage for Parts II and III. \r\nThe project will take a lot of time, but won't be particularly difficult so long as you do the readings and understand the data structures you are creating. I can't stress this enough: THE PROJECT WILL TAKE UP A LOT OF TIME!!!\n\r\nExams:\r\nIf you read the other reviews you will notice that her exams are really really long. Use this to your advantage, if you don't understand a question just skip it, there is no point wasting time trying to decipher a question. I would also suggest never asking questions during the exam, it takes too much time and you could be answering questions you know the answer to instead of waiting for an explanation from the TAs or Meesh. Don't worry, she curves like crazy, I had something like a 78% and got an A.\n\r\nBook:\r\nMeesh posts a lot of stuff on her website. Use those resources, they are very helpful. Do the readings, they will really help you understand the intricacies of the data structures (and sometimes provide pseudocode).\n\r\nMisc:\r\nI took the summer version of the course, which had the projects shortened slightly, but topic coverage was the same. I also worked 20 hours a week at my job while taking this course and managed an A (although I spent almost all my non-work\/non-class time working on the projects). ","889":"This professor does not teach,she uses years worth of material stored and maintained by TA's in lieu of teaching.  Time is spent performing administrative tasks in class, telling stories, cancelling class, and talking about how much she \"cares.\"  The truth is she doesn't care because students are walking away from her class thinking they have a good understanding of the concepts taught.  With a general bit of knowledge and the heavy curving on the tests you would have a tough time failing tests even if you tried.  Don't waste your time with this professor if you want to be successful in the field, use your time with professors like Dave Mount or Samir Khuller.  ","890":"He's by far the worst professor I've ever seen. Some people say he's good because he wrote a bunch of thick books - but even those are not great. He talks down to everybody, beginning with students, and ending with his TA and fellow professors. (At the classes he talks about how other professors teaching the same class are so much worse than him, and how their slides are stolen from other people...) \n\r\nThen there's this Quadtree project, which is supposed to be written in C\/C++ or Pascal. Still even though he claims to be an expert in all of them (and all Computer Science, for that matter), he constantly demonstrates he doesn't know what he's talking about. But again, according to him, everybody is wrong and only he's right.\n\r\nAt the classes, he sticks to his slides and rarely gets up from his chair. Whenever someone asks something that is not explicitly explained in there, he gets angry, saying that we're supposed to know it already. That may be acceptable if after saying it he would actually do the explanation, which of course, he doesn't (I suspect that's because he doesn't know anything out of those slides...). \n\r\nHe's paranoid about using electronic tools like the submit server or the grade server - because of this, it's hard to keep track of your progress in the class. We've just taken the final, and if we want to find out our score, we have to go to his office...\n\r\nI guess the only good thing about this course is that it teaches you how to work on your own, and not expect it to come from your instructor - in a way, it's a good life lesson... \n\r\nI wouldn't take any (other) course with him!","891":"I once heard Meesh say: \"Never use a binary search tree. If you use binary search then I'll laugh at you, because you're stupid. Use hashing.\" So useful! So up-to-date!\n\r\nOn the first day of class, Samet spent 15 minutes comparing methods of string representation based on how much memory you can save by SHARING COMMON SUBSTRINGS. He claims to have lost the old Macintosh software that created his slides, and they're all marked Copyright 1997. You have the option of turning in your quadtree project in Pascal. So, not exactly cutting-edge.\n\r\nThe projects are all, without exception, sorely under-specified. For all of the projects the TA had to post lengthy clarifications to make the projects possible.\n\r\nRight now, the early morning (!) section with Subrahmanian is full. Every time someone drops from that section, someone from Samet's section jumps ship, so Subrahmanian's stays full. 15 or so people actually show up for class every day in our section.\n\r\nThe infamous quadtree project is ridiculous. Within the first couple days of class you have to turn in your specification for the data structure. Four weeks later it must be completely finished supporting 15 different operations, along with a text-based command parser, makefile, etc. All code must be completely from scratch, and you'll need to implement a linked list, a heap, and a binary search tree (heh heh) during this time to finish your quadtree. We didn't get to quadtrees in lecture until December, so you need to figure everything out by reading his 1000+ page tome. And if, like me, you escaped 216 without ever learning how to use gdb then you'll have to develop a feel for that too because it's impossible to write 2,000 lines of bug-free anything (let alone C) without a fully-featured debugger.\n\r\nMany weeks of class are wasted learning Lisp, which has nothing to do with data structures. Those projects are straightforward compared to the quadtree project, but they're nontrivial. \n\r\nThe tests are hard. For the first midterm, out of 24 exams (by the way, note that the class started out full with 40 students) 1 got <30%, 2 others got <40%, 8 others got <50%, 7 others got <60%, 6 others got <70%, 4 others got <80%, and 1 other got <90%. So only 5 people got above a 70%.\n\r\nI can't say it was a total waste of time, because I did gain a lot of experience writing crappy C code, but if I wanted to do that then I'd have taken OS.","892":"Do not take Data Structures with Samet.\n\r\nHe knows the material well- he literally wrote the book on it, and he'll make sure you know it. He'll talk down to you, make a big deal about how you don't know anything, and not actually teach you very much you haven't already seen before in other classes until way after you've done the projects on them. He assigned us the notorious quadtree project, which while a fun exercise, isn't fun when you have only the first three weeks or so of the semester to finish it. If you aren't experienced writing thousand-line projects with C\/C++\/Pascal, if you appreciate your Friday nights as times to not do work, or if you like teachers that give you reasonable test cases and use the submit server instead of making the TA grade your output by hand... you will start hating this course very early if you take it with Samet.\n\r\nHe teaches on overhead slides and \"animated\" pdfs. He teaches us to think recursively, and teaches us how trees work, and seems to think he has a better definition for just about everything in Computer Science than everyone else. (He doesn't.) He doesn't use the submit server because the process \"isn't human enough\" for him.\n\r\nHe really really does know his stuff. He's a smart guy, but he teaches you the material in vague, opinionated terms using materials that a) largely haven't been updated in over a decade and b) don't really correspond with the rest of our CS education.\n\r\nBut hey, he's still teaching the course, so he must be doing something right... oh, that's right- tenure. Never mind.","893":"Probably the best thing about this guy is that he is very smart and knows what he's talking about. Unfortunately, thats where the good things end.\n\r\nOn the the first day of class, he assigns the notorious quadtree project. Although the first two parts of it are very easy, parts 3 and 4 are complete hell. Samet himself gives no instruction on the project himself, instead telling you to learn about quadtrees from the long project description and gigantic textbook of his. He then goes off lecturing us about linked lists and other stupid structures we already learned about time and time again.\n\r\nDuring lectures, he simply reads off lecture slides which he wrote, making lecture extremely boring. He tries to engage students by calling on them randomly and asking them questions, but (unsurprisingly) people rarely ever answer them the way he wants. If you don't learn the material from lecture, you have two other resources to learn the material from: Notes on Data Structures and Multidimensional Data Structures, two books which were also written by Samet. So yeah, you basically learn stuff by reading the same material three times. And don't try to learn the material from somewhere else: Samet has carefully added his own opinion and bias to his course materials, and these are often important for the test. If you put down that \"an advantage of doubly linked lists is that you can traverse backwards\", he will frustratingly mark you wrong.\n\r\nHe seems to have this delusion that CMSC 420 is the only class his students are taking, and that we spend all of our time on it. It is not below him to assign extra homework assignments and lectures whenever he wants, and he often does this, even when students are buried in projects or other work for his class. We had class Tuesdays and Thursdays, and he would literally assign extra lectures on Fridays, and then would get upset when only 8 people showed up to them. \n\r\nSeriously, I don't know what people see in him. My rating is based solely on his TEACHING, not on his intelligence or research. It's people like Samet that really make we wish the tenure system is abolished and that teaching departments actually had some quality control.","894":"Intelligent\n\r\nHe is sarcastic at times but quite insightful during lectures. He knows the material very well (much of it deriving from his own areas of interests) while capable of going beyond the normal curriculum. However, do be discrete about questions as he will digress\/rant at times if they are bad. Pre-reading lecture slides are not necessary imo, just careful understanding during the lectures. Projects may be seem long but are relatively easy if you understand the problem's nature. Exams were relatively easy","895":"I think the best way to write a review for Dr. Samet would be in a list\r\nformat, so here it goes:\n\r\n1) His teaching style is not engaging and will put you to sleep.  He asks\r\nthe class many questions, and it's rare that students ever answer them\r\ncorrectly to Samet's standards.\r\n2)He has an extremely abrasive personality and talks down to students like\r\nthey're children.  I felt like I was in middle school again many times\r\nthroughout the semester.  He also spoke badly about other professors in\r\nthe department in front of the entire class.  He literally said most of\r\nthem don't know anything, especially about simple things like linked\r\nlists.  I found this to be absurd and very unprofessional.\r\n3)He was away on travel a lot throughout the semester and re-scheduled\r\nclass a few times on different days than when class originally took place.\r\n Whenever some people wouldn't show up to these re-scheduled sessions, he\r\nwould chastise the class and lecture us about how he's taking the time out\r\nof his schedule to lecture us and how everyone needs to be there.  Problem\r\nis, the class was on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and rescheduling the class on\r\na Friday evening means half of the class won't be able to be there because\r\nof work, other scheduled activities, or other private matters.  Samet has\r\na really difficult time understanding this.\r\n4)He's a smart guy and has been teaching the material for so long that he\r\ncompletely understands it but expects everyone else to understand it at\r\nthe same magnitude of his understanding.  This makes him have a difficult\r\ntime coming down to the level of undergrads and understanding that most of\r\nus are absorbing the material in the class for the first time, hence most\r\nof us actually having to learn the material.  He constantly refers to\r\ntopics in the class as common sense and gets agitated when students are\r\nleft feeling clueless from his awful teachings.\r\n5)The infamous quadtree project gets assigned on the first day of class,\r\nyet he teaches absolutely nothing about quadtrees.  He told the class to\r\nlook at some Java applets that show examples of how quadtrees work and\r\ntold us to go read his encyclopedic book.  That project was the most\r\nhorrendous project I've done at UMD and the major reason why it was so\r\ndifficult was because I didn't have a good understanding of quadtrees as I\r\nwas left to research them on my own.  It would've been extremely helpful\r\nif he spent the first few days of lecture talking about the mechanics of\r\nquadtrees and tips on how to implement certain operations.  Instead, he\r\njumped right into teaching us data structures we've learned as freshmen\r\nand assigned other homework assignments on top of the newly assigned\r\nquadtree project.\n\r\nThere are other things about Dr. Samet I could mention, but I feel that\r\nthe five things listed above should provide a decent foundation of what to\r\nexpect from him.  In regards to the class, I found the exams and some of\r\nthe homework assignments to be difficult.  Besides the quadtree project\r\n(which has to be implemented in C, C++, or Pascal), the remaining\r\nprogramming projects are all done in Lisp and are straight forward.\n\r\nI don't recommend Dr. Samet for this class, and if I could go back in time\r\nI would've taken it with another professor as I truly don't feel I've\r\nlearned much from his class at all.  I feel like I am walking away with a\r\nsemi-understanding of some convoluted, advanced data structures and the\r\nknowledge of little tricks that can be used for simple data structures to\r\nsave space that pointers\/references take up.","896":"He is a very smart man, and wants to teach.  He grades tests very fairly and is willing to take time out of his day for you.\n\r\nIt may well seem like he has difficulty coming down to the level of undergraduate students to explain things in a way we easily understand.  However, a lot of the difficulty in learning from him can be alleviated by pre-reading the material in the textbook (or, more specifically, the extended notes corresponding to the lecture slides) before class.  He expects you to pre-read, which is reasonable but quite time consuming.  If you don't pre-read, it will be hard to learn from his lectures.","897":"Excellent professor, makes this class very approachable and informative.\n\r\nClass project was fair difficulty but the TA will walk you through it if you put in the appropriate effort.\n\r\nWay easier than Samet's 420 section, so choose this guy 10\/10 times.\n\r\np.s. He taught Meesh so this guy is quite knowledgeable in his field.","898":"I really like him a lot. He makes learning seems easy. His style of teaching is to tell you the overview of the main stuff first - then, give multiple examples until you understand. He cares for students and he explains well.\n\r\nHis exam so far wasn't hard and his projects are pretty straight-forward. His homework may require you to think a little. But as long as you go to class and do the hws and projects, you'll be fine. :)","899":"This class was the worst class I have taken at the University of Maryland. The teaching style is horrible. Larry Davis simply reads off the slides and rarely has an example of what the data structure looks like and how it should behave. And if there is an example, it's just pictures in the slides that are missing all the steps. I put in a significant amount of work into this class and the grades I received were too low. You receive no sympathy whatsoever. If you have been having trouble in another class and been overwhelmed with work you will not receive any consideration. I spent hours and hours every week teaching myself the material so I have put significant effort in this class. In addition, the projects have a 30% late penalty, meaning that the highest you can get is a 70%, it is a pointless late deadline, you would actually do worse if you kept trying. This was a horrible experience and I do not wish to go through this again. This has confirmed to me that professors are not meant to teach. It's reflected in their attitude towards the class. It's only a few that do actually enjoy teaching but from my experience here at the CS department most profesor like Larry Davis should not teach. I taught myself everything this semester. I should not be paying so much money to teach myself everything. I highly recommend the department to consider hiring Lecturers instead. When I was taught by a lecturer there was a significant difference, they actually enjoy their job and better convey the material. Professors like Larry Davis should remain focused on their research instead of making students suffer through this. Just because you have a higher degree or a tenure does not allow you to treat students the way you treat them. I am extremely upset about this class, I was really excited about this class but Larry Davis turned it into a nightmare. If you can avoid taking this class with him please do.","900":"Incredibly rude professor, constantly yelling at people for asking questions or for not having known material. In our class, someone joined the class late because somebody dropped the class so they got on off the waitlist. Samet spent the first 15 minutes of the class lecturing the guy who joined late saying \"this class isn't a train, you can't get on and off whenever you want, you need to have done all the homeworks already. Where are they??\"\r\n\r\nThere's no grade server or submit server, he made us print some of our projects and hand them in, and we didn't receive grades until a couple days ago. There's also no elms page, and he hasn't sent a single email or message on elms out. All he does is sit there and yell at people, definitely would not take.","901":"this class is hard as hell. She doesn't come to class. So all of the lectures were on google hangout. Really struggled in class","902":"His lecture style was hard for me to follow. Sometimes it felt like he had just learned the material that morning. His slides that he posts on ELMs are excellent to teach yourself if that works better for you. I think he will improve as semesters go on because he seems to take notes of what he does wrong and tries to correct his teaching style.","903":"Jason's project description is very unclear, which made projects even more difficult, but the midterms and final are fair. Also, you can skip all the classes since there are recordings and slides. ","904":"Kind of a pretentious\/power hungry TA IMO. Takes off arbitrary points on projects. It seems like he's trying to make CMSC420 a hard class (maybe to make TAing it seem more respectable?)","905":"Pros:\r\nClass is fair (not difficult)\r\nMaterial is interesting\r\nGrading is fair (our first midterm was hard, but then the final was a joke)\r\nHis TA's are generally good\r\n\r\nCons:\r\nJason can be a bit disorganized\r\nSuper understanding (especially if you go to his office hours)\r\nProjects can be challenging (again talk to him if you're struggling)\r\n\r\nI would definitely recommend taking Jason's class!","906":"Overall good TA. Spends too much time making memes though :)","907":"Best professor at UMD. Lenient grading on exams and homeworks. Engaging, enjoyable lecturers. Fair project difficulty. Also answers every piazza question personally within 24 hours, often quicker.","908":"Dave's a great instructor  He knows the content like the back of his hand and lectures are never stuffy.  \r\n\r\nHe takes questions seriously and is happy to deviate from his plan if some interesting question got his attention.  Even with the large class, lecture often felt more like a discussion.\r\n\r\nMy class was a little disorganized because he was rewriting the syllabus as we went, but he was always upfront about the changes he was making and what delays to expect.  He took time to develop useful assignments rather than just relying on the materials past instructors used.  \r\n\r\nHis future 420 classes will probably have more assignments; the difficulty will probably depend on whether you like using homeworks for practice or if the extra work is too much for you.  Either way I highly recommend Mount.","909":"I think his previous reviews were when he was a very new professor. He has definitely improved a lot since then. He is one of the best CS professors I have had at Maryland.","910":"Marsh has so far been my favorite computer science professor. All content he covers through lecture is clear and complete, so it leaves out ambiguity. His tests have been very fair (despite making the switch to online exams). He has been extremely responsive to students this semester and he has been very active online even before quarantine. Take him for 420 if you get the chance.","911":"Explains things well and provides exercises for students to practice","912":"One of the best CS professors I've ever had. Marsh is a very kind and interesting person as well as a very attentive and well-organized professor. All lectures were well presented and all projects were fair. He was very generous with project extensions when they were warranted. Tests and homework assignments were extremely easy. It would take great effort or supreme procrastination for one to do poorly in Marsh's CMSC420 section. Highly reccomend. ","913":"Really responsive and well prepared for online lecture","914":"Really good professor, but he uses Jason's projects and he hasn't read the src code so you won't ever know how your code gets tested. He'll review your code from a theory pov, however his mini-exams every week and his lecture videos are perfect.","915":"Awesome teacher all around. Overall great class.","916":"In my family, I am perceived as the \"smart one\" and basically forced to help my younger sibling in 6th grade math homework. Admittedly though, nothing much is learned during these tutor sessions because I cannot fathom how what I 100% understand to be difficult and because I do not have any teaching skills at all. Now imagine me, but now I am over 70 years old, very unfamiliar with very recent technology, and is paid to teach. That is basically professor Hanan Samet. He is really smart, having pioneered research into Computer Science and even has his own wikipedia page. But all that matters is if he can teach college students and my god he doesn't.\r\n\r\nTaken him with online classes, his lectures were boring and barely understandable. Most of it consisted of him going through a pdf of illustrations that are hardly understandable by itself, therefore you have to watch the lecture so he can explain what it all means, but then you can't get through the dull barrier or understand at all. Also for some reason the slides and chapter pdfs given do not support ctrl+f, and this is especially bad given that these things are huge pages of text.\r\n\r\nThe big project seems to be the same each time according to the other reviews, but this time the project was split into parts with different due dates. While I appreciate it making me keep my procrastination in check, the project was still god awful. This mostly comes down to the information on the project like the project description. I've learned more on how to do the project from piazza than the pdf given. At one point, plenty of people received zero's because the hidden tests were exponentially larger than the sample ones given. Fortunately we were given a second chance to edit our project, but I wasn't happy having to edit in C of all things. They still made us use these weird huge inputs for the later parts that just makes it too difficult to debug. Oh yeah instead of using gradescope or the submit server to submit code, Samet uses Elms. Gradescope is used, but only for written homework.\r\n\r\nI should have known this professor was not gonna be good at all when the only section open for 420 was him. I wish I actually saw all these previous reviews before I was too desperate to take something for the semester. If I had the ability, I would go full Jimmy Neutron and time travel back to the exact time and location I was signing up on Testudo. I would slap that laptop out of his hand and tell myself to get a new laptop, because it's way cheaper than the tuition taking his class.","917":"Fantastic instructor. He knows his stuff and teaches it well, is very kind and understanding, and makes the class interesting. If you see that Dave is teaching a class, TAKE THE CLASS!! He made online school a little more bearable. ","918":"Dry on details with the quadtree assignment along with a poor teaching style with hard to follow slides (that he hasn\u2019t updated since 1998) make for my most frustrating course in UMD this far.","919":"Best professor I have had in the CS Department, I definitely recommend taking a class with him. You will learn a lot!","920":"Pretty straightforward class. Jason's slides are EXTREMELY descriptive and he takes his time in lectures to go through material step by step. Exam averages are in the high B's, projects can be a little difficult but nothing too extreme. ","921":"I had Professor Marsh for CMSC420. Previously, I had him for CMSC414 and did not have a great experience. This time I thought that he did a much better job in how he taught the material and the assignments that were given in class. The projects and exams were very reasonable and it was one of the better upper level computer science classes that I have taken so far. ","922":"His recorded lectures are easy to understand and go over. His exams aren't too bad. Projects can be tricky given how much he tests on edge cases. Overall a pretty good professor and really understanding.","923":"Meesh doesn't teach. Simple as that. You're on your own to learn the material for this course. It's not hard to get an A because the grading for the exams is so weird (as long as you write something down, you'll get at least 1 point for a problem) and the projects are pretty easy. But if you have the option to take literally anyone else, do it.","924":"Definitely one of my favorite professors that I've ever taken at UMD! He does a great job at breaking down the material in order to understand it better. He provides lecture videos, hand written slides, LaTeX notes, and small bite sized videos for every single topic that he covers. He's also super accommodating and he's very responsive on Piazza and email. I felt that his tests and homework were fair, and the projects were well written and applicable to what we were learning in class.\r\n\r\nThe only complaint that I could really think of is that grading might be a bit slow at times. However, It turns out that he graded ~190 midterms by himself.\r\n\r\nHighly recommend him as a professor!","925":"Really caring and helpful professor. Absolutely take him if you can. However, be warned that this is not necessarily an easy class. Although the projects are fine, the homework and exams require critical thinking on certain questions that only a few people may get. Nevertheless, Mount provides recordings, drawn notes, slides, shortened videos, review sessions, and more to help you succeed, which is really amazing that he goes to this level to help us succeed. One of the best professors in CS. ","926":"Simple put, a terrible professor. I regretted taking this class with her - worst decision I ever made. Don't be like me because even if you get a good grade, you will literally have no free time and not learn a single thing. ","927":"The course structure is confusing but she did check Piazza quite often. The exams are long but are graded leniently. Projects are pretty straightforward (mostly because of Mount's lecture note). ","928":"Easily one of the best CS lecturers I've ever had. Both his written slides and LaTeX notes are extremely helpful. he does normal lectures during class, and has fast-forward lectures that take around 15-25 minutes to complete. Explains material really well, very open to questions, and is always open to feedback. If you put in a lot of effort in his class, he wont fail you. Definitely take him for any class if you have the option to. ","929":"Great professor and an even better person. The other reviews aren't lying at all. He really does want you to succeed and tries his best to teach you. \r\n\r\nThis class is not easy, though. I found the exams to be tremendously challenging (admittedly I didn't put too much effort into studying, as I had a very loaded semester with other classes as well), with pretty intense critical thinking in time constraints. This class isn't an easy A by any means, but you will come out understanding a lot about the data structures he covers in class, and their different variants. His notes are fantastic -- i loved his lecture videos and how organized everything was, even amidst the online environment. \r\n\r\nProjects are pretty easy, all things considered. I procrastinated and did them the day before and didn't have a problem getting everything submitted, although I might say that for some projects it was kinda stressful because I did this. He also does side-lectures to help you with the projects, which are super important. \r\n\r\nOverall, I'd recommend the class -- not necessarily because it's easy (it's definitely not easy lol), but because Mount is so great. ","930":"He does seem to be lenient at times with due dates and is somewhat of a good lecturer regarding material for a new teacher, but there are complaints about his grading policies during this summer term. Using competitive programming sites like SPOJ and then basing 70% of the grade based on whether it gets accepted or not (you\u2019d most likely want to use C for its speed despite being told to use any language since a lot of the time others will still fail even if correct due to the execution time) as well as grading the midterm with a fairly low average resulting from a rubric that assumes information that wasn\u2019t clear in a few questions leaves a lot to be desired.\r\n\r\nAnd the TAs could\u2019ve been more helpful too.","931":"He really cares about your learning and wants you to succeed. Yes, due to SPOJ, the course is a little hectic, but you will grow a lot as a programmer as a result. \r\n\r\nThe TAs were not very helpful, especially at debugging C. Sometimes when I went to office hours the TA hadn\u2019t even looked at the project yet and was not supplied with project solutions. Hopefully in the future, he can be a little more stringent on the slacking TAs (though not all were bad.)","932":"He was pretty chill and provided pretty good lecture sources. He's really helpful for answering questions because he's good at explaining concepts and diagramming them, though his lectures can get a little long-winded which is why I usually watched David Mount's lectures and asked him questions about those concepts afterwards. His exams are quite fair and he doesn't test you on anything you never learned before.\r\nSo the pros?\r\n- Chill and friendly\r\n- Listens to student concerns (not guaranteed to comply with them but he listens LOL)\r\n- Doesn't test you on what you didn't learn\r\n- Good at answering questions\r\nCons:\r\n- Lectures can be long-winded if not directed by student questions\r\n- Grading for coding assignments has had some debate (some coding assignments had incorrect specifications but Alejandro tried his best to help out)\r\n\r\nNot the best but also not the worst, though it's his first time teaching and I would say he's done more good than harm so I'll give him a 4\/5 stars.\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nA lot of the struggles in this course could have been greatly alleviated if we had more effective TAs. Personally, the TAs were really helpful for answering questions that they knew answers to but most of the time they weren't caught up with the lectures on what we learned (it's not necessarily a bad thing but it made office hours really useless at times). However this is only a side-note and will not affect Alejandro's rating since it's not his fault the TAs did not learn the same thing that he was teaching.\r\n","933":"Really nice and respectful lecturer. Empathetic and lenient for sure, but there are areas for improvement. I think this is a great example of a lecturer giving resources for their students to learn, and not so much ramming the information into their head. The exams were extremely fair (take this from someone who did poorly on the first and well on the second), it's truly just a matter of time investment (in my opinion). There might be controversy surrounding the SPOJ approach (basically medium to hard leetcode but without the thousands of accessible solutions), but it's made me a better programmer. Moreover, this has forced me to learn C++ (I did the entire class in C++, not sure why the other comment mentions exclusively C), and since there is no (to my knowledge) class that teaches C++ at this university, I really appreciated this. \r\n\r\nIf you're looking for an easy A in 420, probably not the professor for you. If you're looking for an enthusiastic, young, relatable lecturer who will make sure you get what you should want out of an upper level programming class, just sign up. \r\n\r\nAlso, the project that the most students struggled with, Alejandro made it so that you practically are given a 70% for turning literally anything in, and a perfect score would come from getting AC (accepted) on SPOJ. The benevolence is real and appreciated. \r\n\r\nJust for reputability, I'm a senior and this was my last class for graduation. Not my best performance, but probably my favorite and most impactful class (seriously, I may never go back to python ;) ). ","934":"I liked this class, in particular giving the coding assignments as SPOJ problems was a good decision, it helped me to get started with competitive coding. Also, it would have been better if he used some other platform like Leetcode\/Geeks for Geeks. But overall, given that Alejandro was teaching for the first time, it was a nice experience.","935":"The first semester teaching any course so obviously, there was a learning curve on both sides. The midterm was way too difficult with hard-to-follow and unspecific directions and unfair grading with a 63% class average. Luckily the final exam was a lot fairer with a way higher average score. He was lenient with due dates and grading for the final\/regrades. There was a 1% curve in the class with about 75% of the class getting Bs and up.\r\n\r\n","936":"Alejandro is a nice guy and very accommodating about due dates with projects. However I felt he could've been more organized with regards to the class, he didn't have a syllabus until the end of the first week and decided at the last minute to replace a homework assignment with a project and scrambled to find a project. Projects were done using SPOJ and they were really annoying because you ran them on the website and a huge chunk of your grade depended on them passing under a certain time. Theoretically you could use whatever language you wanted but youre better off using C++ for speed. The TA's for the most part were not that helpful and sometimes wouldn't show up to office hours\r\n\r\nDuring lectures he's very dry but more helpful one on one, also Professor Mount's notes are the GOAT. He's very strict about formatting for exams which I understand wanting to reduce grading time but it's annoying because not all of us can print or edit PDF's.","937":"I felt Alejandro was a very good professor. Summer classes can often be chaotic as they are fast paced and have very few TAs. But Alejandro gave good lectures and had very reasonable expectations on the exams. One or two of the seven projects were pretty difficult, but I felt they made me a much better programmer. Some students really did not like that C++ usage was pretty much mandatory in this course (generally this course is taught in Java) but to be honest, there was very little you have to actually teach yourself that you won't already know from learning C in 216. Also, I felt the TAs could have been a lot better, but that is mostly on the department, and not Alejandro's fault. Overall Alejandro is very nice and the class was not terribly difficult. 30% of the class got As, 45% got Bs. That's about as good as it gets for upper level CMSC courses. And the things you learn are very useful, I watched some FAANG interview question videos recently and many of the questions can be solved with data structures you will learn in this course. \r\n\r\n","938":"Alejandro is very new.  I took the first class he taught on his own and his lectures could definitely have been smoother and the ideas presented in a more coherent order.  I got the impression that some of the lecture material was presented in the order he remembered it.  He would be 30min into the lecture, realize something didn't make sense, and then realize it's because he forgot to explain something earlier in the lecture.  He is quite caring and often worried that his English was difficult to understand though I never had trouble understanding him, and think that his lectures will naturally become better organized the more he teaches this class.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the projects.   Alejandro's projects are different to Mount's and his grading requires that solutions are both correct and efficient.  Moreover, the projects aren't just mechanical implementation of each data structure.  Often they are challenge questions where most of the work is in thinking up a solution, rather than implementation.  They make you intuit when different data structures can be used in real world problems and were very beneficial to my programming.\r\n","939":"This class was a bit of a learning curve ngl, but it provided invaluable skills and concepts that can be applied in the industry or at least coding interviews. Alejandro is one the most understanding instructors at UMD and is very approachable. I say that you should take this class before you graduate, preferably with him.","940":"Alejandro is incredibly approachable and helpful, he responds quickly to emails and piazza. He is knowledgeable and lectures well. Grading issues mentioned in other comments are noticeable but most of the projects were easy or well telegraphed by the course material so it sort of works to the effect that you have a higher grade overall by the end except for the midterm and maybe the last project or 2. Even then, noticing that most students were unable to get project 6 in the summer session, he altered the grading scale to be more fair, so like I said, he responds to students' issues quickly and helpfully. ","941":"Great lecturer, keeps students engaged and tries to always ensure their understanding. I have mixed feelings about the SPOJ assignments. I appreciated being introduced to the platform, and I think it emphasized the difference in speed from using one approach versus another which I normally would not be able to detect. However the prompts are sometimes very vague, and the edge cases can be very hard to guess, so I spent more time guessing obscure edge cases and less time on understanding the course material than I would have liked. If given more adequate time I think Alejandro could have designed assignments more tailored to the data structures we were studying. ","942":"The material was as difficult as it should have been, and there were many resources given that would help understand it. The programming and homework assignments were fair and completable, some required deep thinking and the TA's were often able to help.\r\n\r\nThe class was however rather disorganized, but it is fair to mention I took his class in his first semester of teaching and I believe this is something that will improve as he teaches more. He had a good plan (at the end of the course, it was easy to see how each topic contributed to the next topic), but I think his inexperience and the fast pace of summer courses made it more difficult to follow in real time than it could have been.\r\n\r\nOverall I give him 4\/5 because despite the disorganization, I came out knowing a good amount about each data structure, the assignments were fair, and he was really receptive to input from students.","943":"Unorganized, unprofessional, hectic. Held TAs to no standards. Lied about what programming language we would be using. Stay away take and take this class with Mount. ","944":"Class was unorganized this summer, but it was his first time ever teaching a class. Alejandro was a good TA when he TA'ed for Nelson and I am sure he will become a great instructor some day. He genuinely cares about teaching his students the most relevant concepts and pushing out some outdated material. He's a definitely was really accommodating to anyone who had an internship or job over the summer. ","945":"Do not take this professor at any cost. He will give you an assignment without teaching you anything. He can't even teach. He will want you to read the bullshit book he wrote, and you can't even hear his voice. It is a total mess. I don't know about any other professors but take another professor instead because there is nothing worse than Samet. ","946":"Since the switch to online, Marsh has been an incredible teacher. I had him for cmsc436 and cmsc420 and for both courses he did a \"flipped\" course, where he posts very clear and concise online modules where you have to watch usually 3-5 broken up (roughly 5-10ish minutes each) lectures twice a week and do a quiz. This is nice becuase it makes class optional becuase its just a session where he goes over examples and lets people ask questions (no clickers or no material taught, so you can skip if you know the material). Quizzes are super easy if you watch the lectures and you get multiple attempts.\r\n\r\nExams are extremely fair and heavily resemble homeworks assigned (due about once every 2-3 weeks for 420) or slides from lecture videos. He also made the 420 exams online and open note even though we are back in person, which is very nice. His exams come at the end of every module (also about 2-3 weeks) and are mini exams that are NOT cumulative. The final is the only cumulative test.  the exams overall also only account for <30% of the grade, which is good if you somehow bomb an exam.\r\n\r\nThe projects are where he puts heavy emphasis on and theres usually 5 projects (one per module) worth 10% each so 50% total. He has a strict \"turn in late and get a zero\" policy but don't let that worry you. His projects are very reasonable, Office hours and his campuswire (online forum like piazza) are very helpful and the projects are usually given 3 weeks to finish, I find myself only needing a week or less in most cases though (and Im no genius). He stays away from heavy edge case testing and tests are a mix of public and release (you can only see name of test), but no secret tests.\r\n\r\nOverall he is my second favorite CS teacher behind Nelson and I highly recommend him for 420 and 436, but I've heard not so great things about 414 with him.","947":"He is very mean. Don't take courses with him","948":"I took this class in conjunction with CMSC414, and the difference is quite astounding. Comparatively speaking, this class is much better put-together, it is easier to follow, and definitely doesn't suffer the same issues as CMSC414. The course material is relatively easy, and the slides are quite useful. Marsh himself is an alright professor, but his course materials are probably a bit more useful than his actual lecturing. The logistics of the class-- Campuswire, GitLab, etc. -- are not ideal, but they are manageable. The projects are quite tough, but they are in Java! If  you are ready for a decent workload, I would recommend this class. Marsh seems to have a pretty good grasp on how to teach data structures.","949":"Marsh was very organized and taught very well. Exams and homeworks were very fair and we knew what to expect for them. Projects were very difficult and tested heavily on edge cases, so make sure to start those well in advance of the deadline. ","950":"I took this course in Fall 2021.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n+ Very effective lecturer, asynchronous lecture videos had all the content you need but were concise enough to be not too long.\r\n+ Projects are explained clearly and are very doable in the time allotted\r\n+ Listens to student feedback and is very adaptable (especially pertaining to COVID)\r\n+ Is always happy to answer questions\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Marsh uses a flipped-classroom model, where you view lecture content at home, and actual lecture class time is used for discussion\/answering questions. I was personally not a fan of this, as it just led to there being unnecessary 420 HW and having almost nothing to do during class time. Barely anyone even showed up to class.\r\n- Partial credit is very harsh, you typically lose points for selecting the wrong answer AND not selecting the right answer, so you essentially lose double points\r\n- Compared to midterms, the final felt almost \"abstract\" in its questions, was definitely much harder than the midterms","951":"Probably the best professor in the CS department by far. You can tell he really cares about the students. I had him Spring 2021 (online semester) but he has handwritten \"slides\", printed notes, ad lecture videos for you to learn from. He was engaging and really receptive to student concerns. You could tell he prepared and knew exactly what he was talking about. The exams weren't the easiest, but if you study the content and the homeworks you should be able to get by. I'm pretty sure he said he hasn't had a student get below a C in a long time, so study hard and you'll be good!","952":"Two stars because he was a nice guy.\r\n\r\nI learned very little from this course. He is a tenured professor and it seems that the department threw him in to teach this class after Jason left again. The exams were easy and didn't test on most of the course material. Our midterms were worth 15% each and our homeworks were worth 11% each....\r\n\r\nHe clearly did not prepare to teach this course, and used Dave Mount's notes as a fallback for any lack of preparation on his part.\r\n\r\nThe class was not difficult, but we are here to learn. If you like to cram for exams and learn nothing take him. If you want to actually learn the content take anyone else.","953":"Professor Marsh puts a lot of effort in and makes everything very clear and explicit. The assignments generally help you learn the material well and prepare for the test.","954":"You SHOULD take Marsh for CMSC420.\r\n\r\nI took the course in Fall 2021.\r\n\r\nProfessor Marsh is an amazing teacher. He had a flip flop style class, where his lectures were posted online and there was a quiz that was due before class time. The online lectures were really clear. The quizzes were unlimited time and you had unlimited attempts, so do you what you want with that information. In class, he went over examples problems that explain the algorithm and they were really really helpful. He recorded those in class lectures too, so you didn't even have to go to class. There were 4 exams that were online and the averages were always in the 80s and 90s. He gave us enough time with the projects (2-4 weeks) and they were all very doable and really helpful in understanding the algorithms better. The projects were all in Java, while there was another teacher who made the projects in C, so this is another benefit of taking Marsh. The final was harder than the other exams since it was more abstract, but it was only worth 10% of your grade and he gave a lot of partial credit, so it was fine. ","955":"She doesn't teach anything. She simply uses other teachers lectures and YouTube videos. Her exams are INSANELY long (20 pages) and take insanely long to actually complete. If I had the decision to go back in time, even if other professors didn't have space, I would choose another class to completely stay clear of this professor. ","956":"Prof Srinivasan is genuine and cares about his students. \r\n\r\nPeople are saying that he just \"falls back\" on Dave Mount's course material, but to me it seemed that Prof Srinivasan did not lack any knowledge at all on any of the topics we studied. Yes, he does use Dave Mount's course material, but I do not think it is out of laziness... Prof was always prepared and knew his stuff. Dave Mount's course layout is just GOOD, and the extra provided resources were great to have in addition to lecture material. This way, we didnt have to buy an expensive, boring book. Using Mount's course is no different than using a textbook, except Mount's resources are much better than any boring CS textbook. \r\n\r\nHe was very clear with exam expectations, and doesn't make your life hell with homework. \r\nThe projects and homework are representative and provide good practice on what is actually taught in class. \r\n\r\nProf Srinivasan's way of teaching was unique and very appreciated: instead of trying to make you memorize every little detail, what was most important is that you understand the concepts, why they work, when you might want to use them. \r\n\r\nI am so glad that I took 420 with Professor Srinivasan in Fall 2021, I had a very good experience. \r\n\r\n","957":"The best professor I ever had \r\nHis slide and explanation is rational and clear\r\nA question on piazza will be answered within 2 hours ","958":"He teaches way better compared to other CS profs. But he likes proofs. If you are not into proofs like me, then you will be disappointed doing his homework. Other than that, he is nice. If you don't mind being asked to prove something, consider this a 5-star rating. He is good in all other aspects. ","959":"This lady is very rude and condescending to her students who are simply trying to ask questions. Her attitude made it an environment that was difficult to learn- or want to learn for that matter. I did well in the class, only because I worked hard; she was not a good resource whatsoever!! Exams were absurd and incredibly long. ","960":"Stay away unless you are only choosing her class for the semester.","961":"Don't take him if you can. He sometimes gets lost when he teaches. He tried to make class engaging by asking questions, but his teaching style is not that great. He is not a professor that would say stay away from but try another professor first. Almost forgot; his midterm was very hard, and it was long compared to the time given, so many students didn't do well. \r\nif the other professors you can enroll with are either Hanan Samet or Michelle Hugue, stay away from them at any cost. I repeat, stay away at any cost. If you don't do that you might as well not read reviews. ","962":"I took 330 with Eastman as well, and I got a B+ in that class too.\r\nHe's a super chill guy, always willing to take the time and answer questions.\r\n\r\nMy main complaint is that he's not the most organized. He was going off Mount's notes for most of the semester, but he was also trying to mix in a lot of runtime analysis and derivations for the data structures we were covering, and sometimes that leads to the lectures being slightly confusing.\r\nExams are also long and pretty difficult. But overall the class is manageable and interesting.\r\n\r\nIf you have Eastman for a class you'll be fine.","963":"One of the best professors in the CS department. His notes and short lectures are incredible, and he has the class fully figured out and knows exactly how to teach it.\r\nHe's really into proofs though, and if you're challenged in that area then homework and exams might be a pain. But Mount really wants you to succeed and he provided as many resources as he possibly could.","964":"Can't go wrong with Mount, his exams are on the difficult side but it follows very closely to the homeworks. If you understand and can do the homeworks you should be fine on the exam. This class is also curved at the end of the semester so as long as you do average on exams you will pass. He also answers piazza questions thoroughly and in a timely manner.","965":"as said by the other reviews, just an amazing professor. highly recommend!","966":"Personally, the lecture style wasn't for me as it was a lot of reading off notes, with a few examples here and there. My biggest gripe is that by using pre-written notes, he was able to cover so much material, to the point where it was overwhelming. He does provide a lot of forms of the material which is nice. For each lecture, he had latex notes, handwritten notes (he presented these in class), in-person lecture video, and a prerecorded video where he creates and explains the handwritten notes. As others mention, he is a bit more theory-heavy than some other profs. The course was overall easy (except for exams... which required a lot of prep but were mostly fair), but I will be honest in that I don't feel like I learned much. This is because the projects were simple enough where they didn't really require too much understanding and the homework was infrequent enough that you could get away with just trying to match the lecture notes procedures, rather than truly understand them. Some of this is my fault for sure, but the limited amount of assignments meant I wasn't practicing concepts. Anyway, I would say the course is fairly easy except for exams. Mount is a very nice guy though and he'll tell you if you're on the right track with homework and other assignments. Last thing, you are allowed one two-sided cheat sheet for each exam, and you can bring previous cheat sheets to subsequent exams (one sheet for first exam, two for second exam, three for final). The cheat sheet policy is nice but means that there can be more difficult exam questions. Prepare your cheat sheets carefully because they can really help with certain questions. He always provided ample practice material for exams, so that was nice.","967":"Very good lecturer, however, made this course seem like 4 credits instead of 3. \r\n\r\nExams were fair and averages were good, however the projects were insane. During Thanksgiving break he modified a Mount project which only had 3 required methods to implement, and instead required us to do 8, along with ML which was a topic not previously discussed in the course--hence the 2\/5 stars. \r\n\r\nI would not recommend him for this particular course. He also wasn't very helpful if you had coding questions and was curt on Piazza sometimes. \r\n\r\nStick with him for MATH courses, not CMSC.","968":"Doesn't know what an HDMI cable is, haven't personally taken his class, but be warned, he knows not what he says!","969":"He's trying really hard to change this course and make it interesting. The biggest fallback comes from trying to change it too quickly, often mid-semester. Long-term changes to a course are appreciated, but within a semester a course should be completely consistent (e.g. the professor should have the labs prepared in advanced), otherwise it can be stressful to the students.\n\r\nOtherwise I thought his teaching style was decent and the class was pretty cool. I learned a lot. I got to do lots of awesome things that I had never looked into because I wasn't sure how to do them legally. He was pretty nice and accommodating when I spoke to him. I was just stressed out about my grade for most of the semester because of how frequently details of the course changed. And Capture The Flag is awesome, but shouldn't be a graded assignment, since that brings it straight from something fun and interesting to something worrisome and annoying. ","970":"Prof. Katz is a pretty good CS teacher. He teaches on the board and does not just read off of a powerpoint. The midterm was moderately difficult, but the final was in-class, online, all multiple choice and was easy.\n\r\nProjects and homeworks were cool, but honestly there could have been more (assuming you actually liked the topics)\n\r\nBiggest issue with this class is that 50% of the people come in with not a clue about any of the topics and with no security background and the other 50% has experience and knows a bit already. This makes the class either too easy\/boring OR too hard\/too fast. Can't make everyone happy, but this gap can make the class less enjoyable.","971":"He's on OK professor. I didn't really go to class because it was boring (not the prof's fault).  But he put up the slides online.  Exams are actually pretty easy but everyone does badly on them (trust me, I'm no genius).\n\r\nThe projects\/homeworks are awesome and entertaining (best part of the class).  The course gives you a good overview of things, although a good 25% of the course seems common sense.","972":"Summary: Very average professor.\n\r\nLecture:\r\nMostly off of power-points which he posts online. Going to class is optional, but questions on the quizzes will sometimes come from things he says during class that are not on the power-points. The actual material was usually very interesting, but there was so much material to cover most of the time we just brushed over topics without really learning how they worked. Taking CMSC456 before this class will give you a slight advantage (very slight).\n\r\nQuizzes:\r\nThere were 3 quizzes which were pretty hard. They are all short answer or diagram drawing. I felt the quizzes would emphasize a random subset of the material covered, so if you are weak on a certain topic and it shows up on the exam you are screwed. On the other hand it could not show up at all and you get lucky.\n\r\nProjects:\r\nThe projects were actually pretty fun as we got to carry out things like buffer overflows, dictionary attacks, and XSS attacks. They also more or less got easier as the semester went on. Languages used were C, Java, and Javascript. He provides resources and examples if you don't know Javascript, I taught myself everything I needed to know for the Javascript coding in less than an hour.\n\r\nFinal:\r\nIt was a little harder than the quizzes I thought. But it is only worth 12% of your grade, which was a weird concept as I am used to it being between 30% and 40%.\n\r\nGrading:\r\n5 projects 11% each\r\n3 quizzes 11% each\r\n1 final worth 12%\n\r\nOverall the material was interesting, but it seemed crammed. I think this would be a good first 400 level course as it gives you a nice overview so you can think about concentrations you would like to focus on in future courses. ","973":"Professor who clearly knows her stuff. However, I'm not sure if it was the long class block or the presentation, but I struggled staying awake every class - especially about private and public keys. The programming assignments are kinda fun, but can be really challenging if you don't have the right mindset. Exams were alright, she allowed cheat sheets, but still lots of potential material. I'd maybe recommend to a final semester senior.","974":"He is the worst professor. Just reads off the slides and gives like 4 15 minutes excercises in class. Doesn\u2019t give answers to these exercises. He forced everyone to use elms discussion instead of piazza. Exams are extremely hard avergae was 52 for our first midterm. He doesn\u2019t have time for his students. 1 hour of office hours per week and that too for 414 and 417 combined.i am not sure what grade i have in this class. Extremely unorganized professor. Biggest mistake of my life to take 414 with him.","975":"Helpful","976":"worst class ever.  Don't even know what I should get","977":"AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING Professor.\r\nOne of the best professors I had at UMD.","978":"Wonderful lecturer. Great teacher, and great guy in office hours. His projects are difficult and the specs contain typos, but I believe that is the fault of the grad student TAs, not Dave's. I recommend taking the class, but make sure we're working with someone.","979":"Wish i could give a zero rating for his Excellenc in organizing lectures and his remarkable project readmes ","980":"Nice guy. Worst professor I've ever had.  I could go into all the reasons, but frankly it would just be exhausting, so I'll just say this:\r\n\r\n>He is bad at communicating\r\n>His project descriptions are borderline unfollowable\r\n>He only holds one office hour a week that is shared between 417 and 414\r\n>His test grades are almost always wrong and you have to ask him for points back every time\r\n>His grading is completely opaque unless you bug him for his inputs\r\n>He forces you to use elms discussion boards and does not respond to any student questions posted to elms\r\n>His lectures do not cover exam topics, they just give general, high level explanations of things\r\n>He does not understand the math behind cryptography but tries to teach it anyway\r\n>If you take him, you will learn everything on your own DURING the test\r\n>He gives assignments that take much longer to complete than he says they will (his catch phrase is \"30 minutes of coding per problem\")\r\nThe list goes on...\r\n\r\nIf you take him, prepare to be paying for nothing\r\n\r\nI wasn't gonna list everything, but I did anyway. Woops. There you go. Avoid at all costs.","981":"Best lectures I've had for a computer science course. Lecture recordings were also posted online so attendance wasn't mandatory. Exams and projects weren't easy but they were certainty fair. Highly recommend taking CMSC414 with professor Levin.","982":"Worst computer science professor I've ever had at UMD. He puts this university to shame, and the worst part is - he's a pretty nice guy (it's so frustrating).\r\n\r\n- lectures are downright impossible to follow\r\n- he gives high-level explanations and then tests on low-level code implementation\r\n- his take home exams require the use of libraries\/tools that have bad documentation\r\n- his take home exams are heavily biased towards students who have already taken cmsc417\/cmsc456\r\n- warning: if he gives take homes, prepare to devote 20-30 hours of work to it and watch the average be a 40-60%\r\n- his grading scripts are terrible and you always need regrades\r\n- he uses elms discussion boards instead of piazza\r\n- he's stubborn, unhelpful, and oblivious in general\r\n\r\nMy advice? Avoid this class at all costs, and don't take any class with this professor. Not worth your time.","983":"Love this man. We would do our work in the student lounge, he would pass by and say hello since he recognized us and would hang out for a little while or ask us about the class. Always went up to him after lecture to ask questions and he was very cool about it.\r\n\r\nThe material itself I became less and less interested in. The exams were quite open ended. A lot of short answers and a few multiple choice or word bank style questions thrown in. I did awful on all the exams, but fortunately the projects for the class were 50% of the final course grade. I did very well on all the projects but they were quite challenging...Basically they are a bunch of individual tasks you have to try out and they range from write a .c file that does this or make a txt file with a piece of code that does blah. \r\n\r\nI really disliked the final project which was a paired\/team project. It caused me a lot of distress. Also several people did not submit a working project so there were only 20% of the class where you had to try and 'break' their code and write reports about it.\r\n\r\nTaking this class, I learned that Security is NOT for me. This class was more security than it was Networking which I actually like a lot more. Maybe the last month or so was focused on the Networking aspect of the class which I found quite disappointing.\r\n\r\nIf you like security and networking, Dave is the man for you. His shiney bald head will make you fall in love with him.","984":"I agree with everyone else","985":"Favorite cs professor ive had. great lecturer. super nice guy. projects and exams were extremely fair","986":"Project grades are always off by at least 20% because he trusts his \"scripts\". Exams are tough, hard to study for. And everything else is as other reviews described. Terrible professor.","987":"One of the co-teachers for 414. Dude knows what he is talking about, but is a bit of a douche to students in class.","988":"Knows her stuff, but is quite boring. Her exam questions are also not up my alley. Nice person though.","989":"He seemed like a good professor, but I think co-teaching 414 was a mistake. Between the three professors (Bobby, Michelle), he was the best lecturer but was barely there and oftened talked about the more interesting but less important (for exams) topics.","990":"She is not a good lecturer.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\nClass cover a lot of interesting topics\r\nMaterial is genuinely interesting for the most part\r\n\r\nCons:\r\nShe is a very boring an ineffective lecturer\r\nShe is a harsh grader\r\nExams are tough\r\nProjects are tough\r\nBad at communicating\/grading\r\n\r\nI would avoid taking class with her. I recommend taking Dave Levin if you can","991":"Great lecturer, poor administrator. He co-taught the class with Bobby and Michelle and logistics were an absolute nightmare. Project descriptions were changed in random, unpinned Piazza posts at a whim, right up until the day a project was due. Points were deducted arbitrarily as there was no grading rubric and no defined test cases on the submit server like there are in other cs classes, so if you fail a single edge case that might have been covered in one test on the submit server, it could cost you a lot of points. After a while into the semester his lecture start to sound more like Ted talks than informative lectures about cyber security. At least they were entertaining. Build it break it at the end of the semester was very disappointing. Most of the points were just for writing a report, and there was very little emphasis on actually trying to break your peer's code.","992":"Marsh was fine (clearly knowledgeable, willing to take feedback, friendly in office hours), but he insisted on spending the entire class reading from his slides from behind the podium, almost totally still.  The room tended to be dim, and his voice was steady and soothing. . .\r\n\r\nThe final was unexpectedly all multiple choice, not ideal for me, but the curve was strong.\r\n\r\nOverall, I'm not going out of my way to take Marsh again, but he's not a dealbreaker.","993":"I was scared to take him based on past reviews, but I'm happy to say he was great. Great lecturer with interesting material and anecdotes. He was truly nice and understanding. Responded quickly and helpfully to questions. I also had read that he used to live and die by his automatic grading system. That is no longer the case and is more than willing to go in manually and re-grade something, even if it was your fault for misformatting some output.","994":"He is a super passionate professor that knows a lot about security. His lectures are great since he seems to really enjoy it, and brings up ideas from his research and experiences. The only negative of his lecture style is that he doesn't do a lot code modeling which hurts some students.","995":"Does not help you prepare for exams whatsoever. What's the point of showing us previous exams with no answers? Likes to ask random trivia questions that you'll never find even if you search the whole internet. Tough projects that are worth too much of your overall grade, no late deadlines either. Genuinely regret taking this class with him, honestly a miracle I passed","996":"(Disclaimer: had him during fall 2020 virtual semester)\r\n\r\nHe\u2019s a really chill and caring professor. Some of the projects were a bit difficult, but he provided plenty of extra credit so you can definitely make up for a poor project grade with that. We were virtual so tests were open note, but I thought they were fair. ","997":"Dr. Marsh was a pretty solid professor.  He was really accommodating during the pandemic and tried to make things as easy for us to understand given the circumstances.  While I had some complaints about the tests and the format of the material, he was helpful in clarifying any confusion and was really open to hearing suggestions for how to teach the course virtually in the future.  The projects for 414 were really fun and interesting, but also challenging and really made you think about the code rather than just mindlessly typing.  He also was flexible with regrade requests on projects and exams, which probably saved my grade when I realized later on that something was wrong.  ","998":"Although Dr. Marsh was nice and a lenient regrader, I found his lectures and in-class exercises to be very boring and unintuitive.  All content lectures were pre-recorded, and during our actual class time, we would ask him questions and watch him do exercises.  He explains concepts in high level terms that make it difficult to understand as a student who is learning about cybersecurity for the first time.  I would ask him questions about certain topics so that I could better understand them, but it became a chore as the semester went on.  He is very smart and knows a lot about the concepts that he teaches, however I was able to better understand these concepts by watching youtube videos that covered them.  Homeworks and exercises, while intellectually challenging, taught me more about how to navigate unix systems and find bugs than about computer and net security.","999":"Insists on using campuswire for some reason when literally everyone else uses Piazza. Also insists on using Gitlab when everyone else uses the submit server. In 414 he gave us previous exams but would straight up refuse to answer or ignore us if we asked what the answer was. Rushes thru slides and expects us to know every single small detail about a topic, but at the same time will assign homeworks and projects that barely have anything to do with what he tests you on. Also in 420 he made exams super long for no reason, you wouldn't have finished unless you used other resources or asked your friends for help or saw the exam beforehand.\r\n\r\n Avoid him, you and your GPA will thank me later.","1000":"414 Spring 21; very unorganized lectures, did a meh job of explaining things, talks very fast, uses jargon and doesn't explain. He just wrote things down on the iPad notes app? and his handwriting is garbage\/very hard to read; that plus general disorganization made it very difficult to take notes. inaccessible outside of class. no exams because of covid, only projects. interesting stories about crypto and cyberattacks and how things came to be are a plus but otherwise it was hard to learn from him.","1001":"Really interesting lectures and great instructor!","1002":"Micheal doesn't teach you and expects you to learn all of the material outside of the class.","1003":"Awful, awful professor. Lectures are incredibly high level with absolutely no application involved. Grading scripts make countless errors, which he promises to resolve, but WILL NOT ALWAYS if you are unlucky. Incredibly disorganized course webpage.","1004":"Michael Marsh is a decent professor, but his classes can be quite difficult. I would NOT recommend taking CMSC414 as your first upper-level class. Definitely take something else first to get used to how they operate. This class is very dense, the material is tough without a lot of background experience, and the projects can be overwhelming. The logistics of this class can also be very annoying. The slides, homework, and exercises are supposed to be helpful, but without some prerequisite knowledge, they can be incredibly difficult to use. Due to the structure of the class I would only recommend taking this if you are ready for a very large workload. I'd imagine someone much more prepared than I was might be able to succeed quite well in this class, but I also imagine my position is a pretty common one. Be careful going into this class, it will challenge you.","1005":"Pros:\r\n- All exams were timed, open note, and open internet. They were not structured to be extra difficult because of this caveat. The final was supposed to be in person, but got moved online.\r\n- The goals for assignments (home works and projects) were fairly clear. It takes some time to adapt to Marsh's \"unique\" approach to projects in the class, but office hours and campuswire were always open and the instructors actually answered questions (Most of my previous class piazzas had questions ignored on piazza)\r\n- Marsh genuinely cares about the course.\r\nCons:\r\n- Lectures are asynchronous. You watch the lectures in your own time, and the lecture itself was a \"discussion\". I attended almost every in person lecture, and it was a waste of time.\r\n- All of his projects are graded with bash and python scripts, and you submit through a gitlab commit. You will always have that feeling in the back of your head that the project might not run the same on his system. \r\n- This class has A TON of overhead knowledge. C, docker, git, bash, python, linux, etc. You aren't expected to be an expert, but you will spend a lot of time learning content independent of the class just so you can do the projects.\r\n\r\nOverall I recommend 414 with Marsh. This is the CS class I had the best experience in. It doesn't hold your hand, but help is there if you need it. It is structured in a way where you ACTUALLY LEARN stuff on your own. With that in mind, you have to put in work to do well in this class. Do not expect this class to be a free A unless you already have security knowledge.","1006":"He's nice and includes all sorts of really cool cybersecurity stuff in the lectures including some of his research. The course organization was stressful at times BUT he also gave us a million extensions and wild amounts of extra credit, and the exams were easy and take home. So it all works out, 5\/5.","1007":"I have a love-hate relationship with this course. I have come to the conclusion, after much flip-flopping, that although Marsh has a bit of a strange protocol for running a course, he is my favorite CS instructor. At first it is a little tricky to get into his headspace, but once I had my head around the groove of the course I found it very enjoyable. I thought that the projects were fun, and that Marsh really wants his students to succeed in the course. He is always responsive and willing to help out and give feedback. Marsh himself is your most valuable resource in this course, I think. I highly recommend 414 in particular, but I would recommend Marsh as an instructor for any other course as well. I would absolutely take a class with him again.  ","1008":"Idk what the rest of these reviews are saying. When I took the class this year, I thought Mazurek to be very organized, the class structure to be good, and the class as breezy. She's a good lecturer too, she explains what is happening security wise very high level but yeah her voice is very soothing and if you're not paying attention then yeah, you might fall asleep. The late days on project policy is awesome. \r\n\r\nFor reference, I think I went to about 60% of the lectures, and would binge watch a couple before exam time, and get decent B grades. Even then, I was able to get a pretty good grade in the class. One qualm that is valid that I see echoed here, however, is that the projects sometimes do not have enough set up or foundation for someone who is new to these security concepts to finish thoroughly. I am biased because I came into this class with some general knowledge and experience with how security worked, so the buffer overflow project, the XSS project, and other projects were pretty good. Still, others that I knew who didn't have security experience did pretty well on the projects when they went to office hours. \r\n\r\nThe class is chill, and I would compare its difficulty to 1\/3-2\/3 difficulty of 250 with Jason Filippou; and 1\/4-1\/2 the difficulty of 216 with Herman. I personally had a lot of security concepts solidified in this class, and learned a lot about the way security does work, and have come away with a greater appreciation of the technical aspects of security to the high level design and concept-wise approach to security. ","1009":"Marsh has a bad rep for CMSC414, but I don't agree with it whatsoever. All his exams are online open-book open-internet, so they aren't stressful at all. He gives quizzes before the scheduled class time, but you have unlimited attempts on them and all together they added up to 6% of your grade. He had 4 midterms (one for each unit: programming errors, cryptography, networking, human incentives) and some of them can be tricky, but even if you mess up they aren't worth a lot of your grade. He uses a \"flipped-classroom\" model, where he has us watch videos before class and during class he answers our questions on any material. As a result, not many people showed up to class (I personally stopped going after the second week). One thing I will agree with the criticism about Marsh is that his projects are extremely open ended. The lectures are more or less useless in trying to figure out what he wants you to do in these projects, and you'll find yourself banging your head against a wall for a few days trying to get started, but he gives a lot of time (close to three weeks) for each project. Overall, I'd whole-heartedly recommend Marsh to anyone wanting to take CMSC414.","1010":"Arbaugh was frequently absent from class and he had his TAs teach for him.  He took the projects from other universities, didn't do them himself, and rarely understood what was going on with them.  Given how frustrating this class could get, it's insulting that he doesn't seem to give a hoot about the class, when he's expecting us to spend 12 credits worth of effort on a 3 credit class.\n\r\nAlso, I'm sure some people knew that Arbaugh was planning on teaching 412 in Windows instead of a unix-based system, but they really, really need to put that in the course catalog or something.  Yet another thing Arbaugh could have done to make this class more reasonable.\n\r\nIn short, he sucks.  The only reason he didn't get a 1 is because he is actually quite knowledgeable.  He's not an idiot -- just a jerk and a flake.","1011":"Lectures are pretty dry and difficult to follow. Exams are based mostly on lecture material, so looking at his online notes to prep is a must.\n\r\nProjects are very time-consuming and specs are often frustrating as they do not accurately reflect what actually needs to be done in a clear way. By far the longest and most complicated programming assignments I've ever had in an academic environment; make sure to start early and ask lots of questions.\n\r\nOverall, not a great experience. Maybe not quite as terrible as its reputation, but projects can get pretty ugly. Best bet is to take the class with people you know and discuss with them about the projects (at a high-level).","1012":"Professor: He does have a stutter, but if you pay attention you will have no trouble understanding him. This does however make his responses to questions slower than normal. He will also give tips on how to do well in his class and stuff like extra non graded assignments if you need more practice if you ask him. \n\r\nCoursework: Projects are very difficult. Start early (no really.) on all of the projects and be prepared to ask for help from the TA's. Exams are medium. He grades hard, but his cut offs are low. So even if you do bad on one test you can easily make it up. If you study you can do well on the tests. But studying can be a problem if you get behind on a project (projects are sometimes due 3 days before the exam date).   \n\r\nGrades: He curves the tests and does something with the projects (I did badly on a lot of them yet still passed the class). He will not give you any extra credit or extra assignments if your doing badly. If you fail you fail.\n\r\nBottom Line? It will take a lot of work to do well or even pass this class. However you will learn a lot about OS's. Its also looks good on the resume and can give you a idea of how good of a programmer you are. Not recommended for a senior class unless you need 4 credits. ","1013":"This is a horrible class. The projects are impossibly difficult and the professor is terrible lecturer. His stutter is distracting and notes are all over the place. Average for a midterm is around a 46\/80. Exams are really difficut You will have to end up learning all of the material and then doing all of the projects yourself. Dont take this class with him if you dont have to.","1014":"I have a lot of respect for Dr. Shankar. He is extremely knowledgable on the subject matter. I did feel that too much of the course was spent on lectures about synchronization, but clearly this guy knows that stuff in and out. He does have a little bit of a speech impediment, but it didn't hinder his communication of the material to me in any way. We are all human right? Too many students used the excuse that they couldn't do a project because it wasn't heavily discussed in lecture, but not once have I had a CS course that went into detail about a project, not even 131! It may have been the fact that I was very well prepared for the course because of ENEE350. Shankar is very approachable, in his office or in class, much more so then most professors. He also spent the last class taking suggestions from students about how he can revise the course to better teach his students for the next time he is teaching it. How often do you see that? This guy actually wants his students to learn, and isn't out to make your life a living hell. His exams can be tedious, but they are definitely curved. He is a very fair grader, though you may find that your TAs are not so much. All in all the project is very time consuming, and is worth about 50% of your grade. The project though is not curved! I enjoyed this class a lot, and felt that this class really strengthened my understanding of a vast amount of topics. ","1015":"Neil Spring is a pretty legit instructor. He clearly knows the material and the labs are actually quite helpful. The reason I'm giving him a 4\/5 is because I strongly believe that the content of the class can really improve. We spent too much time learning synchronization primitives, and not a lot of time learning cool things like log-structured filesystems\/networked filesystems, or the inner details of how a context switch actually takes place (something that I believe to be extremely important, yet this detail never really gets covered).\n","1016":"Now, Neil is a great guy and a somewhat competent teacher. His teaching style takes getting used to; he basically walks into class everyday, opens up VI and just types notes, which you are expected to copy down and know. If you take notes on paper, learn to do it by computer, or you will get crazy pissed when he hops all over the place modifying what he wrote. My personal suggestion is Microsoft OneNote. Of course, he posts the notes file online, so you don't really need to take notes, but I would advise you do so, particularly if you're not that familiar with the subject.\n\r\nHe involves the class by basically asking us questions and writing the answers in his VI file. He writes it very colloquially which is nice, but sometimes he uses really obnoxiously large, outmoded words (draconian, pathological etc.).\n\r\nThe way the lectures go will be entirely up to you and your classmates. In my case, my classmates were total geniuses. We have 1 guy who got a diploma from MIT, half the robotics team, and a bunch of other people who basically know everything there is to know about linux.\n\r\nThese people will be the bane of your existence if you are not one of them. They will side track the class, ask really convoluted and (in my opinion) irrelevant questions, and basically confuse the HELL out of you.\n\r\nIt is basically your job to slow these people down and make sure they don't get too many opportunities to derail the class.\n\r\nNeil also gives quizzes if someone's cell phone goes off in the class. So, study your notes every night basically. He also has a huge vocab sheet he posts at the beginning of the semester, with words that will be covered on his multiple choice exams.\n\r\nNow some of you may have seen me say multiple choice, and grinned happily; set aside that notion, Neil's exams are pretty damn bad. His questions are more tricks than tests of knowledge, there are several that can be interpreted to mean different things, and it's really anyone's guess as to what they truly ask. Other questions can sometimes reword the answers in such a way that even if you know what the answer is, finding them among the choices is tricky.\n\r\nThe projects in this course are pure hell for the most part with 1 or 2 exceptions. This isn't really Neil's fault, he delegated it all to his TA, who mismanaged time a fair amount (routinely showed lecture slides for projects 3 weeks before they were ASSIGNED).\n\r\nOverall, it's not easy to review this course, as I don't know if it's me, the TA, the professor, or the course itself that's the problem, but I do put in 40 ish hours a week for out of class work, and I have a C-.\n\r\nNeil is a fair guy though, so I am not too worried about failing\/passing.\n\r\nIf you want an A in this class, and haven't been weaned on linux, then you will need to start reading the book weeks before the semester begins. Make sure you have flashcards ready from a previous semester on DAY ONE of the class.\n\r\nLook over previous semester's projects.\n\r\nThis class is more demanding than any other I have ever taken, and it's in no small part because of the disparity in intelligence of the individuals who take it.\n\r\nIt's going to be a tough, long, hard semester, but keep your head up, and prepare well, and you will get the grade you earn. If your time management sucks, however, prepare for a real shock to the system; this is one of the hardest courses offered at UMD, and you will find out why.","1017":"I would give ZERO stars if I would. This is both the hardest and worst course that I've ever had the displeasure of taking at UMD. I enrolled in this class because I thought that Operating Systems is a fundamental and useful skill to learn, even if difficult, but found out that the administration of this class makes this 10x more harder for literally no reason. There are so many things wrong with this course that I wouldn't recommend ANYONE taking it because it's not worth it. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, others seemed to like the professor's lecturing ability, but I did not. He goes on tangents all the time and is very unclear in his statements that it is impossible to focus. The slides are comprehensive, but are taken straight from the textbook so that isn't really a credit to the professor.\r\n\r\nThe projects and exams though, that is a different hell. Let's talk projects. Each one is incredibly difficult, and the instructions are HORRIBLE. There is really no valid reason why there should be a spec, slides, and FAQ for EVERY SINGLE PROJECT. The spec is awfully written and flat out wrong about things, the project slides are vague and also have incorrect information. The FAQs don't answer certain questions with any new information, and the fact that an FAQ is even needed for a project means that the instructions are poorly written. And to make things worse, even the spec, slides, and FAQ are sometimes not enough. \r\n\r\nOn a related note, administration for this course was TRULY TERRIBLE. Questions on Piazza were just left unanswered even though there were many people with the same question; the TAs just didn't answer and weren't active. I'm pretty sure they were also left in the dark about logistics in the class, because it was near the end of the semester and we STILL did not have breakdowns of grading. That part of the course website was just never filled out. And one of our pop quizzes, which we only had 10 minutes to do and had a very poor average, was worth almost an entire project grade. That is completely ridiculous and shows how little the professor cares about administration for this class. For exams, we didn't get any review material, no study guide or previous exams, zip, zilch, nada. Just \"look at the slides\" which are hundreds if not thousands of slides so it's impossible to study everything on it. In addition, for our final, the professor was very unaccommodating to concerns over the Omicron variant, and refused to move the final online despite multiple CS classes shifting online, and almost the entire class requesting this change. No reasoning was given, of course. \r\n\r\nLastly, our final exam, which is worth a quarter of our final grade, was put on the grade server, and we never even got it back to see what we got wrong, let alone a regrade request. It was simply put on Testudo. This fact may change since this review is posted, but nevertheless it is inexcusable to have these final grades submitted without students seeing the reason, especially when this resource is easily available via Gradescope. \r\n\r\nI get that Operating Systems is a hard concept, but like I said, the administration made this course needlessly more difficult. I am sure that most other people in the class agree with me regarding the majority of the points that I raised here, and there are probably more points that I didn't mention. These points are definitely fixable (having clear grading, clear project descriptions, enforcing Piazza answering, giving us study material) and should definitely be addressed the next time this course is taken. I find that unlikely to happen though, so I do not recommend this course to anyone until then. You're better off looking at the slides or textbook on your own. \r\n","1018":"As other students have and will continue to write, I would give this a 0. As others have noted, 412 is a useful skill, so one should take it? No. It is one of my biggest regrets at UMD. There are literally 20 reasons to not take this course, but some of them include:\r\n\r\nAsking a question about a project that was not due until a week after the exam, which was weighted 18% of the exam grade;\r\nHaving TA's not reply to almost all piazza posts, and never replying the 4-5 days leading up to a project due date;\r\nGiving \"Routine\" pop quizzes (there were 2);\r\nHaving a Participation grade (Went to every class except 1 -- had a pop quiz on that class, and I got an 80 on participation (12 points lower than average));\r\nHaving a 52% on the final exam;\r\nThe professor not even making his own slides, rather uses the slides that the textbook gives;\r\nhas both slides and a spec for projects, both with information relevant, but only found on one or other;\r\nHiding the final not on gradescope where all previous exams and quizzes were placed.\r\n\r\nThere are literally so many more reasons, but just trust me don't take the class with this guy. He comes off as nice, but he grills students for coming in late, but half the class doesn't even show. I could guarantee he doesn't even know the questions on the exam also. Just avoid.","1019":"This is one of those courses where the lecture has nothing to do with the project. The professor is decent lecturing about operating systems concepts, but you're stuck with the TAs to get you through the project which is probably the hardest project in your entire college career.","1020":"Worst class I've ever taken. Stay far away if you want to maintain your sanity. ","1021":"While I took this course during the Covid Times, this Professor was an absolute Godsend. His only requirement to be able to turn in projects late was that you talk to him in his office, which was always a pleasure. He understood the particular pressure that students in his course were under, and worked with everyone who asked on a modified submission schedule. I had never had that with a single CS professor before, and it felt as the Prof. Agrawala truly wanted students to learn. \r\n\r\nAs far as actually teaching went, he was very knowledgeable about the material, and had first hand experience with the making of modern operating systems, which he shared with the class. His slides are yes from the text book, but they are always available on the class website, and line up exactly with the textbook, which he provided as a free PDF (I wish all teachers did this). As long as you read the book and practice any sort of problem that he does step-by-step with the class, as well as study the project slides, you have what you need to know for the exams. He doesn't list out topics for studying, but he also prefaces his course with advice such as, \"get one last good nights rest tonight, that's it for the semester,\" and \"everything you heard about this course is absolutely true.\" Regardless of if it is the case, it's imperative that you get stared on the projects early, and read the textbook. \r\n\r\nThis is not an easy course, and this Professor understands that, but the difficulty in the course does not stem from administrative BS or weird rules. It's hard because Operating Systems are hard, and that's the point.","1022":"The review below isn't really telling of the in person situation at all. Sure, he may have been fine during Covid, but this class has been a complete nightmare in person. Like some of the other reviews below state, he was completely unresponsive to student questions and concerns, and as a result, the class suffered during his extremely convoluted projects and exams. ","1023":"I've had Shankar for CMSC 216 and CMSC 412. \r\n\r\nAlthough Shankar has a stutter if you focus during lectures, write down some notes, and ask him questions, he will clear up any confusions you have.  The difficulty of the exams he gives usually is written by whoever is proctoring the course. In CMSC 216, the exams given were written by Yoon so it was pretty hard. In CMSC 412, Shankar wrote his own exams, which were rather fair if you knew the material (much fairer than exams written by Yoon or Kruskal). \r\n\r\nThe reason why I give Shankar 4 stars is literally because I think he did an ok job teaching 412. I think reviewing a professor's competence should account for the conditions of the course. The biggest change Shankar could've done is go over hints for the projects in the lecture, though this was mostly the job of the discussion section and the TAs. Other changes Shankar could've made were to make his slides less vague and provide more detailed practice exam solutions. \r\n\r\n412 is hard because doing the GeekOS projects take too long, leaving students without much time for other classes and to understand other aspects of Operating Systems not implemented in GeekOS. GeekOS is designed by a UMD graduate, Jeffrey Hollingsworth, Neil Spring, etc. If one accounts for the fact that this project was given to everyone who took CMSC 412, one would realize that this pain is not the fault of the Shankar but the curriculum of the course. Sure Shankar could've changed this curriculum but I don't think this would be too fair. ","1024":"I read the reviews below before taking 106 with herman and was very surprised.  I thought he did an excellent job teaching the course.  Granted 106 is supposed to be easy so maybe that is why I thought he did a good job.  \r\nI almost never had to open the textbook because all I had to do was listen to lecture and then I would have everything I needed to do the projects.  He was mildly funny and kept the class engaging.  To be honest if you actually go to class arrive on time and pay attention you should be able to learn from him. \r\nThe projects were nit-picky, but that is because he has a program grade them to ensure accuracy (But I must say most of the projects were pretty easy for me, although many of my classmates struggled).\r\nThe tests were a little more difficult just because I find it hard to write code on paper (you have to write a short program for most tests).\r\nQuizzes in discussion were announced and generally just quickly reviewing the previous two lectures would give you enough information to get ~36\/40 on the quiz.\r\nSeriously if Herman is the worst lecturer in the CS department then the department must have the best lecturers on campus because he really wasn't that bad.\r\nP.S. go to class and pay attention it really helps even if you don't think it does.\n\r\nI also took CMSC131 with Herman:\r\nSame as above pretty much, a lot of people just have no logic and do not belong in computer programming classes (or the major).  Logic cannot be taught, and if you don't have any then go away, you are annoying to the rest of us that can actually figure things out.  Seriously, he does a good job, if you don't excel in his class it's not his fault, you just aren't capable of the programming logic approaches, which is okay, just change majors.\n\r\nFor CMSC131 Do not buy the textbook, I always buy my textbooks, but the Java book is a waste of money, EVERYTHING IS ONLINE:\r\nhttp:\/\/docs.oracle.com\/javase\/6\/docs\/api\/index.html","1025":"1. Larry Herman teaches at a snail's pace. And by that, I mean an elderly snail that has trouble being mobile. This class is a non-majors CS course, so it goes slower than most CS classes. But the pace at which Larry Herman explains things is simply intolerable, even for someone who has never encountered computer programming. Yet Herman does not even teach effectively. He follows the book closely but does not present the material in an effective manner. He writes long explanatory sentences on the board but does not actually describe what they mean.\n\r\n2. He loves to make the class more irritating than necessary. He doesn't care about his students at all. I found discussion useless since I program in C and Java at my job but didn't feel prepared enough to test out of 131. However since unannounced quizzes were given in discussion, so I had to go. Yet Herman forbade the TA from telling ANYONE when the quizzes were. So each student was forced to either (a) go to every single discussion where the TA (who was horrendous, by the way) mumbled insensibly for an hour or (b) try to guess when the quizzes were and attend discussion on those days. Personally, I thought professors and TAs were supposed to make learning easier, NOT harder. \n\r\n3. Tests and quizzes are fair and well written. \n\r\n4. Projects are fair, but he has an annoying way of saying important things during lecture. For example, due date changes announced the day before Thanksgiving break. Too bad I had a plane to catch. And he never, EVER e-mails out these important little details. He WANTS you to come to class for some obscure reason (aka feed his pride), since his lectures are useless and boring. Clearly he cares more about you coming to his lecture than about you succeeding. \n\r\n5. Projects and quizzes are not returned in a timely manner. Herman doesn't seem to realize that his TA is the worst grader possible, and when told so, he takes no action on it. \n\r\n6. Class website is easy to use and well-organized. The textbook is useful. \n\r\n7. He is a fair grader. ","1026":"I thought he was great. His exams were fair, no trickery, and he gave many practice questions and all his old exams. The projects weren't hard, and he was extremely approachable during office hours. If you went to class and he knew you worked hard he was willing to help with anything. Although sometimes on the boring side, he is an effective instructor and taught difficult material to us non-computer types clearly.\r\nOther posters say he is partial to girls...I am a girl, which could have been the reason for my positive experience\n","1027":"Learned the material well from this class, feel like a C++ pro. Only gripe is that A+'s don't exist, always a bummer to get a 97 or higher and just get an A. Her videos and lectures were very helpful, and even though this isn't about them her TA's were the best I've had in a class. As someone completely new to computer science, this class was great.","1028":"I love Yoon. Best lecturer I've had. He's great at structuring the course and explains things thoroughly. He's also just very personable. I wish he was my dad. Our projects were very manageable, we have like 5 total, 11pm due times, and you have to do the minimums for every project to pass the course. He encourages students to start them early, and it just made for a healthy homework schedule, if that makes sense. He posts review worksheets for exams, lecture slides, and example programs which have all been helpful. I'd say the quizzes are the harder part of the class, but none of them get too crazy. \r\n\r\nOther details... it was a smaller class, mostly math majors, most of us beginners. The lab section isn't as awesome since TA's teach that part, but they do fine. Also, he usually waits until the end of the semester to curve. But yeah, Yoon's a stellar dude.","1029":"Honestly one of the best professors I have had. This class I didn't find that challenging considering we also had like three TA's that were SUPER helpful. Sometimes the Projects we had due were a bit hard but the TAs help you out a lot. Also, the professor is very helpful during office hours and would work with you even after the allocated time until your program is running again. If you know you're going to struggle with projects you HAVE to start them ASAP, so you can get help before the project is due. She is pretty flexible with submitting stuff late due to technical difficulties. She was also very sweet and kind at least to me. If you're taking CMSC106 as a math major whos not really interested in CS, I definitely recommend her.","1030":"BEST PROFESSOR FOR CS! He is so funny and passionate about the topic. \r\nHowever the class is really hard, especially for people who have never coded before, like me. I struggled a lot in this class. You need to dedicate a lot of time to understanding the material. Class is hard but Fawzi is awesome!! ","1031":"Fawzi was an excellent professor for 131. He was really great at explaining the concepts and his projects were fair and fun to do. I would definitely take Fawzi if you get the chance. His class wasn't particularly easy, but if you want to learn the material and have a bit of a challenge take a class with him.","1032":"As an freshman who is a CS Major with no prior experience in Computer Science, I can say that Fawzi Emad is an amazing professor. He keeps the class interesting while also teaching the material in an extremely clear fashion. However, if you are new to programming languages like Java, there are obstacles that you have to overcome (Don't worry, they're not to bad!). \n\r\n1. Fawzi can't review every topic with a fine tooth comb because it's only a semester-long course, therefore the rate at which new material is introduced is fast. You will have to attend pretty much every lecture if you want to be at a good pace, and you must take copious notes - Fawzi doesn't use the textbook (don't buy the textbook, it's completely useless). \n\r\n2. The projects. The first two projects are very easy and doable...however the difficulty then increases quickly. PROJECTS ARE THE MOST CRUCIAL IN GETTING A GOOD GRADE!!! The biggest problem students have with the projects is not figuring out what to do...it's actually completing the project on time. Fawzi gives you about a week and a half to do the projects, but most people wait till the last minute and their grade suffers mightily. PLEASE START YOUR PROJECTS EARLY. I CAN'T STRESS THAT ENOUGH. \n\r\nNow that I'm done addressing those who might be new to programming entirely, let me broaden my view to everyone taking the class. Fawzi's tests are perfectly fair. Not too easy, but definitely not hard as well. Study well, and you'll do fine. PAY ATTENTION TO THOSE STUDY QUESTIONS. They're the keys to a good test score. Quizes and Labs count for a small portion of your overall grade, but make sure you don't BS them. Fawzi's Final Exam was definitely tougher than both his midterms, so don't blow that off and make sure you study hard for that one. \n\r\nFawzi is a fantastic professor and I can't imagine any professor better in the CS Department who is better. ","1033":"Incredible professor. Teaches everything himself; never need to buy or look at the book (nor will it help you to). Take good notes in class; they are your only source of substantial information because truth be told, the online lecture slides (which are written by another professor anyway) are convoluted and give much extraneous information. Do not skip exams (as obvious as it sounds, it happens) or quizzes because he strictly adheres to university policy and will give you a zero. You can get by with showing up late but if you try and leave lecture early he will stop you and  make you feel terrible in front of the entire class. Start projects early (especially those toward the end of the course) since nobody can get it perfect the first time. Review the study questions he puts online, they mirror key questions on the exams.\n\r\nI came into this class a Business major with no computer programming experience whatsoever, but he goes out of his way to make sure that everyone understands the material.","1034":"I disagree with the person one below me. Fawzi is a really nice guy, and he does care about students. You'll find that out if you go to his office for help. \r\nHe is definitely one of the best teachers in the CS department if not the best. Teaching people how to program isn't an easy task, and no one does it better than Fawzi. If you've never programmed before you'll have a hard time while taking cmsc131. It's because learning how to program for the first time is really hard, and you'll have to work extra hard in that class. He'll make sure that you learn all the material needed. He doesn't always write the exams, but he'll look at the exams and make sure there isn't anything that he didn't cover. When I took 131, he was running the class, and he wrote the exams, and the exams were very reasonable. On the other hand 132 was run by Nelson, and the exams weren't that great, but still fair.\r\nYes, CMSC389C (C++) didn't go that well, since it was the first time the class was being offered, and Fawzi tried to cover too much stuff in 3 weeks, which didn't work out so well. Fawzi hates curving, but he ended up doing a 10% curve in that class. Fawzi cares about his students, and he'll definitely straighten out that class the next time he takes it.\r\nFawzi has recently started to teach from slides, since he has some physical issues from writing on the blackboard for a long time, and his doctor told him not to write on blackboard. This is kind of unfortunate.\r\nHe is not like one of those dorky CS professors, he's a very fun guy.\r\nOn response to the reviewer one below me. Fawzi is a human being. He'll only get angry when there's a very good reason to be angry. One time a student was asking Fawzi if he could gchat with him over the weekend if he has any questions!!! You expect your professor to sit in front of his computer all weekend so that he can answer students' questions! Now who wouldn't get angry at that?\r\nI took 4 classes with Fawzi. And I would never take a class with anyone else if Fawzi's teaching it.","1035":"Fawzi is an excellent professor. I went into his class not having any programming experience and I came out with a great foundation in Java.  He really enjoys teaching, so his enthusiasm made the class fun and interesting.  His grading is very fair and he is very helpful and personable.","1036":"Excellent teacher, obviously I'm not the only one with this opinion looking at others people's appraisals. He knows java in and out, explains everything you need to know about the upcoming projects and he's just a likable person. His great personality makes the class bearable. If you have to take CMSC131, try to take it with Fawzi.","1037":"Awesome professor. Makes sense of difficult concepts. Students of other professors always come in and sit in on his lecture because he is always a better teacher. \r\nHis exams are really easy also. He gives 2 mid terms and one final, about 8 quizzes, and 8 projects. ","1038":"He is a great teacher, he is fun to listen to, he has a great way of making difficult concepts easy to understand, and he is quite approachable. Very nice.","1039":"Not all professors are great communicators; Fawzi exceeded my expectations, providing excellent information in easily understood terms. Fawzi's classes had a good energy, making it easy to ask questions and get clear, concise answers.","1040":"I dropped this class. he caters to those who already know the programming language. yes, he has a good personality, but if you don't know the material to begin with, expect to fail. not my fave.","1041":"Fawzi really is a excellent teacher, definitely one of the best at UMD. He explains everything extremely well, providing concrete examples along with easy-to-understand explanations of the material. I didn't have to buy anything for the class (books), just go to class and you will get a good grade, which is easy because the class is very enjoyable. If you can, definitely take a class with Fawzi.","1042":"Had him for 131 and he is damn good. One of the best profs in the CS department.\n\r\nHowever, there is a downside, in that if you don't know some level of programming before walking in, you will have trouble. This is partially because Fawzi does not curve extra to cope with kids who know code inside out and still take the class.\n\r\nAs his GPA spreads say, he is a tough professor, and curves pretty minimally, but in the end, he is a solid teacher. Regardless of the grade you get, you will know the material to a good extent.","1043":"the best professor Ive ever had in all of my educational experience. Very approachable, very cool, very nice. Ver good person, i wish he taught all my cmsc courses. ","1044":"Probably the best teacher I have ever had in college. Don't bother buying the textbook; just go to his lectures and you'll learn everything you need to. He's very friendly and approachable outside of class and will always try his best to help students out. He is pretty fair when it comes to tests, quizzes and projects - you will be challenged, but you will also learn a lot from him as long as you study.","1045":"Fawzi is a great professor, he's incredibly approachable and he'll help you with any problems you're having. His class wasn't a walk in the park but it also wasn't made any more difficult than it had to be. Fawzi's exams were fair and he taught you what was necessary to understand the material you were expected to know. \r\nOne problem was that the book required for 131 was not even mentioned once by Fawzi, I assume the only reason it's required was for the other professor's lecture and sections. Make sure that the text is going to be used before you buy it for this class. \r\nAlso, Fawzi is a computer science advisor for non-freshmen, and he's really nice if you come in wanting to get advice about classes. He's just generally a cool guy.","1046":"Excellent professor, one of my favorites.  His lectures are interesting and he's a fun guy.  He does an excellent job explaining material and caters to the beginners in the class.  Will definitely be looking for him teaching other courses I need to take.","1047":"I took a class with Fawzi a few semesters ago, and he is still the best professor I've had. This was the first comp sci class I took at UMD, and he went into great detail about all subjects, while still keeping the class interesting. I went to just about every class (something I never do now) because I knew I'd learn a lot and have a fun time. Great guy, great teacher...if you have the option, take a class with him","1048":"Dr. Jacobs is a good professor, but he is new at teaching the 100 level classes, so he does not know how to really interact with students that have a very basic understanding of Java, or computing, in general.\r\nI came into the class with a firm foundation, and received an 95% in the class and got almost perfect scores on all of the projects, but I don't think I learned as much as if i were in another teacher's class.\r\nHe works with other professors and so his exams and all of the material come from them, so the students are almost getting it second hand.\r\nHe knows the material and is very friendly and a good person all around, but i am not sure that he is the best teacher to teach the lower-level undergraduates. \r\nIf you can take another professor's class, like Nelson's, then it might be more worth-while and entertaining, but he is not a bad teacher, you just will have to be willing to jump-in in the middle of lecture and say \"what are you talking about\" at some point.","1049":"Professor Jacobs is a nice guy and a good teacher. He covers all of the material that needs to be and try will answer any questions you may have; the emphasis of the previous statement is on \"try\" - sometimes he clarifies the thing you asked about, other times he leaves you more confused than before you asked the question. Overall, he's still a good pick for 131.","1050":"Nelson is a great guy! His personality is so nice and he's HILARIOUS in class. He makes it fun to learn and a lot easier to pay attention in class. I am a newbie to computer science so the class itself was a little difficult. Nelson is a good guy for people new to computer science because he will make your introduction to compsci very fun. \r\nThe first midterm for us was really easy and was just like the practice study guide they gave us. The second midterm was ridiculously difficult. It was impossible for anyone with no experience prior to have done well on that exam. Even people that were experienced were depressed after the exam. As for the final, it was a lot better. It wasn't too difficult like the first one but it was still challenging. Make sure to study a lot and go to all the discussions and lectures and to try to learn on your own time because class time is not enough. This class is tailored more for the experienced kids so being a newbie is quite the disadvantage. The whole \"you don't need any experience prior\" was one of the biggest lies I was told. Also be aware of cheating and copying other people's projects or even collaborating. There was a whole thing this year where the professors are going to prosecute those who cheated on projects which will result in an XF (failure and cheating mark) that will stay with you forever even if you retake the class. It's also better to do it on your own because you learn a lot more that way. \r\nBTW: TA hours are a HUGE mess. It's always packed in the TA office and you have to wait a long time for the TA to even come to you to help you. Kinda why I don't understand why the rules for even talking about the projects together are so strict, but can't really do anything about it. Don't show anyone your code and don't ask anyone for theirs. It's a serious issue.\r\nTIP: Do really well on the projects because those were the only things holding my grade up (as well as the quizzes). You can bomb the exams and still get a decent grade if you do extremely well on quizzes and projects. ","1051":"I thought Nelson was a really nice guy, but his lectures weren't really all that good.  He makes the class easy tho, so if all you're worried about is your grade, you'll be fine.  I recommend taking another instructor (Fawzi Emad or Evan Golub) if you really want to learn something.","1052":"Nelson is a very engaging and fun teacher to have. He enjoys to teach and make jokes at the same time which is very entertaining. Even though he said in the beginning that he will teach like you never did programming before, I believe that is not true. Exams are not that difficult and projects are pretty fair, where as if the class is struggling to finish it, he will extend the deadline. Overall, I would recommend him as a teacher 100%. The TA does not explain the concepts pretty well. ","1053":"Guy says he teaches the class as if none of the students have had programming experience before but that's so false ....... guy sits there and writes code and just gives little explanation. Majority of the class already had programming experience so they understood so the class was clearly catered toward them.  Get Fawzi.","1054":"Wow - these reviews are funny to read. Larry is extremely precise with the material (reason for long project descriptions, too), which makes learning what the code does really easy, and he's very clear about how he wants to be interacted with as an instructor and what he expects of you. If you keep your cell phone away, come to class and actually pay attention, and go to his office hours when you want to talk to him, he's just fine. He seemed a bit harsh on students with certain types of questions at first, but if you get used to the fact that that's just his manner and don't ask questions that he's already answered when you weren't paying attention, no big deal. He's pretty amusing as well, just has a dry sense of humor and is a little bit awkward. I would definitely take a class with him again.","1055":"Wow.... Where to start with this monster of person. Not only does he have the most dry sense of humor but it's like he's allergic to teaching in general and avoids it at all fucking costs... IT'S YOUR DAMN JOB MAN don't tell us stories about some bullshit NASA stuff you made up and how people were just begging to use your code. We get it... comment our code yeesh just teach the damn class. \r\nThe only reason I plan to get a relatively high mark is because I taught myself out of class... I have 100% on all of the projects and labs but shit grades on the exams. Wanna know why??? well i'll tell you... THE MAN DOESN'T TEACH YOU WHAT HE ASKS ON THE EXAM.... although there could just be a situation we may never considered about his case.\r\nHe could be a savant and only understand coding and can't comprehend how to interact with other humans or do his job... If that's the case I'm sorry for my tone","1056":"Basically if you're the type of person that's pretty good with computers and knows his stuff, and goes to lecture, this guy is for you.\n\r\nI've had 11 years of computer programming experience since elementary school, so I found this class to be far too easy.\n\r\nBut I don't think he's a bad professor. He asks questions to make sure people are involved, and he gives hints on what might be on quizzes, etc.\n\r\nBasically, he says to study daily, and YOU SHOULD. I studied C++ in middle school on my own, so these concepts are familiar to me. Also, review the quizzes for the tests.\n\r\nIf you have questions, try to go to his office hours to ask a question. But to be honest, he won't help nor will the TA really help. You really have to figure out what's wrong with your program yourself. Once you get to JUnit Tests, make sure to write little junit tests for each method as you go along. That will help a lot. With your JUnit tests, you can figure out what's wrong easily unlike the submit server's JUnit tests.","1057":"He was a horrible professor. He talked about himself the entire class and what you needed to know and why you needed to know it, but would never actually teach you how to do it. His exams were long and difficult and if you need 20 seconds to finish a line of code he will scream his head off and literally rip the exam from your hand. He does not teach the material and leaves it up to the TA. So if your TA sucks good luck in the class. I never learned a thing from his class even though I attended lecture, reviewed daily, and bought the book. Whatever you do, do not take this exam.","1058":"AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Worst professor I have ever encountered.  Lectures are the most pointless waste of time(I went to everyone) where he spends time going off on tangents that have nothing to do with computer science. Extremely harsh grader when comes to projects and tests.  Due to the snow he attempted to cram every project into the semester, the last being due in a week as we also have finals to study for.  If you have zero experience in Computer Science avoid. The tests are tough and so are the projects expect to put a lot of time into this class. He must enjoy wording the most complex questions into exams. Dont be mistaken if you have learned anything by the end of this class its because of your TA or the people you decided to work with, how Golub has a job here is astonishing.  He gives you study questions that, guess what, have no real impact on tests and quizzes :). Dont believe any of the reviews that rate him from years ago as they do not reflect Golub's terrible teaching strategy.  Not to mention his condescending attitude when faced with question, prepare to be spoken to like a baby.  As an intro course designed for people new to Computer Science courses the workload was by far too heavy his expectations are flawed for students. AVOID AT ALL COSTS","1059":"By far the worst teacher I've ever had in my entire life. First off his lectures are terrible. You don't learn a thing from them. He just talks about life experiences and why you need to know something but he never actually teaches it to you. He's so self conceited you'd think the class was named GLUB131. All he talks about is himself. Impossible to pay attention through the stories in his lectures so when he does actually say something related to the class, you're not paying attention to it. He is BATSHIT insane. Would literally rip students tests out of their hands and yell at them at the top of his lungs for finishing a line of code on tests seconds after he said stop writing. Least personable and reasonable person I've met in my life. Comes off as if he hates all of his students. I received a 77.954 average after putting in more work for this class than any other by far and he wouldn't give me the C+ for the class. DO NOT take this class even if it is the absolute last option. You'll regret it. Golub is just the worst candidate for a teacher. I have no clue who hired him with his psychological brain, but he needs to be fired. Doesn't help a soul being there. ","1060":"Imagine the first day of class. As you embark on your journey through the mystifying complex universe of computer science, you have no idea what to expect. You could be dealing with the unforeseen; singularities caused by Eclipse phenomenons, encounters with fierce, atrocious bugs on the submit server, or even bang you head on your very own $800 laptop as you scream at the ambiguous results of the release tests! A toilet bowl of intellectual thoughts flurries around your noggin; there could be computers, video games, cameras, programming, computers, flying cellphones, virtual pinball and more!\r\nThen all of a sudden.\r\nBAM!\r\nGolub's hairstyle is crazy \u2013 he\u2019s like the Yoda of comp sci. Don't underestimate his powers.\r\nAs soon as you walk through the door, the surrounding air temperature drops 30 degrees as you witness the epitome of the human race. A majestic white haired dude strides across the lecture hall and spreads his arms openly\u2013 with a devilish grin on his face \u2013 so fast you could have blinked and missed the moment of a lifetime. (I strongly advise bringing a camera to savor the moment)\r\nGolub E., or professionally known as \u201cEvan de Golub\u201d, is a retired super villain who now only uses his powers for forces of good\u2026.. for students of the CMSC major at the University of Maryland. He wears a silk vest every day - except on every other Friday. However, I personally felt like when he wasn't wearing the vest his lectures were more interesting and remained on topic. (Escalating theories in the scientific community that this very vest may have been part of his original super villain costume - and retains faint traces of pure evil.)\r\nHis vest is swaggy doe. Props to him.\r\nAlthough his receding hairline may fool you upon first glance, he has a magnificent pony tail and has the full-fledged back-head experience. But keep in mind he is no Lebron James. Golub is an extremely young person \u2013 his hair is only grey from an abundance of knowledge and sagacious wisdom he has accumulated throughout his career. (One, of course, which would take the average man many lifetimes to equal.) Golub is a young warrior, holding years of experience computer sciencing, playing wacky poker in the devious back rooms of mobster hideouts, taking photographs of people\u2019s feet and farm animals, and executing simulations of the mass genocide of pond fishies. But don\u2019t let me spoil the extravagant, Oscar-worthy backstory though. Let the Golub himself reveal it to you through his eloquent novel-worthy lectures which leave you hanging on an epic, thrilling cliff hanger after each 51 minute session. But don\u2019t worry my fellow Golub-goers, he always comes back the next week to continue the story almost where he left off, even after he has given tests that were not on the future topics he touched in the lectures \u2013 but on the stuff you should\u2019ve KNOWN ALL ALONG FROM THE START. Damn, this guy practically wrote Inception. (Before Christopher Nolan bought the rights to it.) \r\nAnyway, at first his lectures might seem pointless, spontaneous, random, unconnected, irrelevant, boring, and really confusing - but don\u2019t let that fool you.  In each session there is a small ten second topic that will become a pivotal test question somewhere down the road. Trust me. All of the spontaneous, random, unconnected, irrelevant, boring, and really confusing tangents he goes on are actually tests, testing the mental capacity of all 140 stude\u2013 I mean 45 students who bother to show up- in search for a new padawan. So if you want the prestigious position of \u201cGolub padawan\u201d on your resume, it\u2019s best you sign up right now and claim your first row seat.\r\nI strongly advise not bringing a computer to his lecture \u2013 this only distracts you from the true Golub-glorified experience. His signature hand gestures during his elegant lectures engage full houses of students \u2013 from all over the world- elevating them to the balls of their feet as he tells witty jokes that no one listens to. Seriously, one time someone almost let out a giggle and the whole universe practically collapsed inward upon itself and imploded. \r\nI suggest bringing the classic pen and notepad \u2013 which were the slim-lined computers Golub himself used when growing up in college \u2013 not those vintage clay tablets developed by the Mayans. (They\u2019re too intricate for the average man!) No matter which type of device you plan to bring, always stare at it and never make eye contact with the master while he speaks \u2013 this is a sign of challenge, an instinct Golub has picked up from his years chillin with lions and tigers and preforming weird combos to their portraits.\r\nGolub is a man with an infinite bag of tricks \u2013 did you know he was bilingual? Early on he\u2019ll amaze you with a programming project that no only asks you to prompt the user in English, but also in SPANISH?!!?! hhhhoooooowwwWWHHHHAAAAAAA?!!?!?! This man is a genius. You\u2019ll soon learn the concept of accounting for different cultural values and measurement systems because Golub exposes the flaws of NASA and unit conversions. During his reign as supervillain, Golub encountered the forces of NASA and recollects how the US measurement of distance was different that Europe\u2019s system, causing the NASA probe to crash (wasting the hundreds of millions of dollars Golub could have used for world domination). He references this story at least once every week, which now in hindsight, I think was a reoccurring subliminal message for comp sci students: don\u2019t trust NASA.\r\nNot only will you embark on pointless, unnecessary projects while other classes are sticking closer to reality, Golub will personally teach you the secrets to his mischievous trade of the wacky poker underground. His wacky poker project seemed too wacky for my taste, but then again, I was never playing a high stakes poker game with 300 zoo animals on the line. Golub is truly a modern superhero. When I took this class I never expected to learn essential life skills including: what Rwanda\u2019s flag looks like in 3 bit-resolution, how to do calculus in Martianese notation, how to program, or even the science behind a fish pond exploiting the true concepts of Darwinism. \r\nBut now I know, and I shall hold on to these precious gifts dearly as I move on with my life.\r\nIf you have been missing a real Bill Nye the science guy in your life, then this is the opportunity of a life time. Golub is a golden star, which luckily this review system can represent for future generations yet to come.\n\r\n1st out of 5 stars\r\nWould take again\u2026\u2026 And audit too if forced by gunpoint.\n","1061":"Terrible professor. Avoid at all costs for your own sanity. The people who give him good reviews are the students that already know everything there is to know about computer science and find his jokes and stories amusing. He spends sometimes up to half of the class telling stories about things he used to do in previous coding jobs that have absolutely nothing to do with the material you are learning, then gives you quizzes on the same material.\r\nIf you are even somewhat of a visual learner that needs to see how things work, do not take Golub. He explains everything using stupid metaphors that he finds helpful and almost never shows actual code in java. Exams are not very similar to the study question posted. As someone below me said, he definitely leaves core topics to the TA's and barely teaches anything in class. So if you have a bad TA, you are in a terrible position.\n","1062":"Horrible Professor.\n\r\nI've taken 115 credits of classes, and this professor is honestly the most incredibly lackluster and astoundingly nitpicky professor I have ever seen.\n\r\nThe first lab was a total disaster, Golub cannot plan logistically at all.  He tried to have over 100 students download eclipse at the same time to complete failure.  This was then supplemented by him blaming the students for this failure, and making the due date for the first lab the next morning (this was considered \"being nice\")  I submitted the project the next AFTERNOON, to which Golub was apparently physically incapable of giving me any points for.\n\r\nSo there you have it!  If you want a teacher who will fail you three days into the class for his own complete incomptence with logistical issues, this is the man for you!\n\r\nI've aced every other assignment he's ever assigned (taken the class in HS), but for your average student, this teacher should be avoided like the plague.\n\r\nEmad is way better, sat in on his lectures, and Emad is much more entertaining\/worth going to lecture for.","1063":"I took 131 with very little prior programming experience (I took a god-awful class in Java when I was a senior in high school). Regardless, Golub's exceptional style of teaching not only drilled all the fundamentals securely into my mind, but also sparked a passion for programming in me. \r\nHe does NOT read off slides; he does NOT drone on the entire lecture. (We all know a professor like that!) He buttresses every concept he covers with fantastic analogies, anecdotes from his own impressive career, and examples of practical implications. \r\nHe takes clicker polls, which may annoy some, but which I found helpful; they motivate you to attend all lectures (which you should anyway) and they help you commit the more important points in a lecture to memory.\r\nHis quizzes are perfectly fair as are his projects. His project descriptions are especially great - visually appealing, lucid, and not too wordy.\r\nHe is not as quick with email responses as some other professors, but he is alright. And he always welcomes questions before\/after lecture and at office hours. He is a very approachable individual who gives students' questions a good amount of consideration.\r\nI have nothing negative to say about him! Look elsewhere in this page for vicious criticisms (LIES, I TELL YOU! haha).\n\r\nTIPS: \r\nSit closer to the front; it'll help you pay attention, participate, and be entertained.\r\nManage your time well in the exams.","1064":"Dr. Golub has received a few negative reviews, but I disagree with them. \n\r\nSure, he's a bit on the crazy side(good crazy), but that's par for the course in college-level science courses, especially in the UMD Computer Science dept(according to friends of mine who are Comsci seniors).  \n\r\nDr. Golub's teaching style in CMSC131 regularly includes real-world examples and previews of things to come in future CMSC courses.  Dr. Golub and his TAs this semester kept a very wide amount of office hours(26 Office hours\/week for our course, in addition to the 5 50-minute inclass hours each week).  You likely will not need the textbook if you're paying attention in class.\n\r\nGrading wise, the 2 tests had 105 points but graded out of 100(5 point curve).  For our class, the median on the 1st test was 79, and the 2nd test was 80.  In addition he dropped the lowest quiz and the lowest lab grade.  Grading for this course was pretty lenient, and it is very possible to earn a little over 100% in the course.\n\r\nI can't comment on how effective he is at teaching as I took this course with a decent amount of prior knowledge of the material.\n\r\nOn the course webpage, we had access to study questions and answers for each week, the powerpoint slides, project descriptions, and some code examples.  The study questions and answers are very helpful in preparing for quizzes and tests, and pretty much all you need to study from.  The slides were pretty much a skeleton of what's covered in class, and were not much help if you had to miss a class or 2.  Project descriptions were clear about what was and wasn't allowed in a certain project, and how to obtain the maximum points.  I can't comment on the code examples as I didn't look at them often.\n\n","1065":"Golub was an okay teacher. His lectures were pretty boring and not always helpful, but he was very approachable and always willing to help. The quizzes were very difficult however. Fawzi Emad is the better option for CMSC131 and 132.","1066":"I have no idea why people are saying she's a bad teacher. If you aren't a bright person you aren't gonna do well in computer science, the material isn't easy to comprehend.\n\r\nThat being said, I had never programmed going into college and got a 100 on every single project.  Jan hooks it up in office hours and bumped my grade when I was borderline.\n\r\nMake sure you practice writing code on paper or it will hurt you come exam time, which is the only reason I needed a bump.  jan is a great lecturer, teacher and person.","1067":"She's nice, but her examples in lecture are terrible. If you're obsessed with cats you'll love her because every single example she gives in class deals with cats. The projects are also very different from what she teaches, if you expect her examples to help you on projects you're wrong, and the lectures aren't very helpful towards teaching the concepts of the class. If you go to discussion, though, the TAs are actually really helpful and teach in a much simpler way than Jan.","1068":"This course was absolutely horrid. This was my first time learning to program and I made a mistake taking it with Plane. She is extremely confusing, boring, and her voice just makes me want to tune her out. Her examples and analogies don't make any sense, either, which causes me to become even more confused.\n\r\nThe lectures were such basic material that when it came time for the quizzes\/projects, I struggled. Quizzes are given every week and for the little amount of time given, the concepts were so much more difficult compared to the labs and the lecture examples. She cannot expect us to understand something at a higher level if she cannot even teach us the basic examples, especially for a beginner Java class (where most students in my lecture had no prior programming experience). The projects were also substantially more difficult than any of the examples ever given in class. Even those with prior programming experience found them to be a little difficult. \n\r\nMy TA was also horrible. She was so snappy and anything she wrote on the board could not even be seen .. GET BETTER MARKERS PLEASE. She never spoke loud enough for me to hear and was snappy whenever a student asked a question.\n\r\nHowever, those with previous programming experience had no trouble in this course. J. Plane basically catered to those who already knew Java ..\n\r\nI am a CompSci major and this bad experience has caused me to reevaluate my choice of major. Hopefully 132 with Fawzi will change my mind.\n\r\nDO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH J. PLANE IF YOU HAVE NEVER PROGRAMMED BEFORE. ","1069":"Sorry to say this, but I feel like this course would be more appropriately titled \"introductory minutia of Java syntax.\" I greatly enjoyed all of the programming assignments, but to be honest, I found the course material extremely frustrating and unenlightening because there was an overwhelming focus on Java's syntactical conventions, rather than the conceptual basis for the object-oriented programming paradigm. All in all, this wasn't a bad course, but I think the content could be a lot better. \n\r\nUnfortunately, Jan also took a rather parental tone towards her students in this class. I'm sorry, I tried, but was unable to find her explanatory metaphors very compelling :( ","1070":"At first I wasn't sure what I thought of Jan. I've definitely never had a professor with her style of teaching and communication. That being said, I thought she did a great job teaching 131. Here's why:\n\r\n1) She is VERY approachable outside of class and is really good at clarifying stuff 1 on 1. If you don't understand a lecture she could probably explain it all to you in a matter of 10 minutes if you're bright.\n\r\n2) She explains stuff and demonstrates what she's talking about by coding in front of you in lecture. It necessarily make the material easy, per se, but it definitely makes it a lot easier to visualize and understand.\n\r\n3) She has a PhD in both Comp Sci AND Education so she knows what she's doing.\n\r\n4) She curved both of her midterms this semester.\n\r\nHonestly, she's probably one of the best professors I've had at Maryland yet. Here's the rub, however, with CMSC131:\n\r\nIf you're not logically inclined (and honestly not exceptionally bright...there's no point in lying to yourself) you're going to really struggle with this class. That being said, Jan is definitely your best option because of her approachability outside of class.\n\r\nRegardless of that fact, I thought Jan was a great professor and I would highly recommend her for CMSC131.","1071":"I had taken computer science classes in high school, but hadn't learned some of the material taught in the 2nd half of the course. \n\r\nI thought Jan was a great teacher. If you came into this class knowing absolutely nothing about java, then I can see how this class could be very difficult. I know a lot of people got C\/Ds on the quizzes. \n\r\nAnyway, the use of projecting Eclipse onto a large screen really helped. Unlike some reviewers mentioned from past years, she only used a few pointpoints near the end of the course. And Piazza was great for communication.\n\r\nI came in dreading this class b\/c of these bad reviews, but I thought it was pretty bearable. ","1072":"She is a really nice professor. She cares about her students but does not mind that most of them are not paying attention to her. She gets really annoying with her cat analogies, but she is a good teacher.\n\r\nShe describes concepts well and exams are not that hard. Quizzes are also pretty easy. The bad thing is that the last project she assigned were almost impossible. They were way beyond our level of programming and I just feel she did not prepare us well for CMSC132","1073":"Jan is a decent professor.  She does a good job teaching the material, but if you have any programing knowledge you'll find the class slow and boring.  Since this is an intro to java course and aimed at people who never programmed before.  \r\nProjects and exams are the same with any teacher and aren't very hard.  \r\nContrary to what others say I found the quizzes to be quite easy, some of the quizzes on inheritance were pretty hard and I failed maybe 2 the entire semester but each quiz counts for very little of your grade.  Just do well on your projects and exams and you'll do fine.\n\r\nYou will breeze though the class if you have prior programming knowledge.  If you don't have prior programming knowledge this class isn't impossible you'll just have to work a little harder and go to office hours or ask a friend to explain it to you.","1074":"I completely hated this class. I really didn't learn anything from the power points. The quizzes were confusing and if you don't know how to program, it's pretty tough. If anything take this class with Fawzi.","1075":"Easy class, especially if you have programming experience. Contrary to what others have said, I believe she did a decent job teaching programming. Her lectures were to the point and covered most of the important exceptions that help. Quizzes and tests were a breeze, as was the final. Labs are very simple and take only a few minutes.\n\r\nProjects sometimes do not overlap with the material being taught, and often take a bit of extra effort, but they are generally not difficult to finish, as long as you start on time. The last project is a bit tricky, though.\n\r\nOverall, a pretty good teacher. I found her lectures helpful, although she does tend to be rather repetitive since this class is geared more towards people without programming experience. Some of her metaphors are quite helpful, I found quite a few of them enlightening, although I can kind of understand being put off by them.\n\r\nDon't listen too much to the other reviews; as long as you actually attend classes and vaguely pay attention, it's definitely a softball class.","1076":"Pros: Jan cares a lot about the progress of her students. I went in to her office hours a few times, and she was a huge help. She's very thorough with her explanations.\n\r\nCons: I found it extremely difficult to pay attention in lectures, and I stopped going after a few weeks. Don't be deceived by the lecture slides posted online, because they don't always cover everything that Jan covers in class.\n\r\nAlso, if you're like me and you prefer to learn everything the night before an exam, don't expect to do well. Weekly quizzes are given to ensure you're keeping up with the material.\n\r\nBottom line: This class wasn't exactly a nightmare for me, but it wasn't all that fun either.","1077":"Jan Plane is a horrible teacher!  She actually does try, but she just makes no sense to me.  About half way through the course I started going to lectures by the other instructor -- Fawzi Emad -- and it is 1000% better.  Mr. Emad explains things in a way that anybody can understand.  If you have a choice, take the class with Emad not Plane.","1078":"I got an A in this class but I cannot imagine how hard it is if you have no programming experience.\n\r\nMy programming experience is very limited but it definitely helped a lot.\n\r\nShe tries to use metaphors but she doesn't understand that metaphors are suppose to be something that students can easily relate to to make things more clear. So when she teaches she just makes things confusing as hell.\n\r\nShe responds to her emails at ridiculous speeds and is very friendly and approachable outside of class.\n\r\nThe quizzes in the class are INSANE. They are so hard and purposely made to hurt your grade. My TA sucked but some of the others were awesome.\n\r\nExams are hard to finish on time (except for the final)","1079":"I consider my  self to be a pretty computer savvy guy, but this was my first programming experience... Lectures were boring, didn't really cover everything I felt was needed for the projects.. Jan did offer help on projects and pretty much does them for you if you go to here office hours or email her constantly.. Thus I received high As on every project.. QUIZZES were IMPOSSIBLE.. I have a D average for quizzes. EXAMSSS.. are rediculous like everyone below me said they are beyond impossible to finish on time and extremely hard.. look to make most of ur points in projects. if you do Well on projects you might just get a B\n","1080":"This class with this teacher is ridiculous.  Not only is she incredibly boring, but she makes things that could be easily understood incredibly hard to understand.  She also LOVES cats and makes every analogy incredibly confusing.\n\r\nProjects are extremely unclear and confusing.\n\r\nExams are idiotic.  She gives a study guide and study questions, and guess what, very few of them have anything to do what showed up on the exam.  SOME of them are based on what she says during lecture but who can understand her?  To top it off, you get very little time needed to complete the exam.  Even the people who have prior CMSC knowledge are struggle to finish on time.\n\r\nDo NOT take this professor, you WILL regret it, especially if you have no prior CMSC knowledge.","1081":"I took 2 years of Java during high school, but chose not to do the AP Comp Sci test, so I had to sit through this class, which was essentially my 2 years of high school Java condensed into one semester. Didn't fall asleep in class, but didn't pay close attention, either. I did most of my learning through the projects. Quizzes were similar to others' experiences. I'm still kicking myself that I didn't take Fawzi.","1082":"This class is beyond horrible, but she was the ONLY teacher available for CMSC131 at this time.  Only those who have prior knowledge in programming will do well.\n\r\nThe first week or two were okay as it was relatively simple and therefore easy to understand, but after that, it gets boring, at least, with this professor.\n\r\nTeacher: She is a really nice lady, she tries to help you as much as she can and is approachable outside of class. However, she cannot teach at all.  She is incredibly confusing, boring, and only she tends to know what she is talking about.  She makes things that could be easily understood even harder to understand.  She makes a lot analogies, which are freaking horrible as they only confuse you further.  (She uses lecture slides and refers to examples she puts up on screen.)\n\r\nTA: My TA was pretty nice, but she follows the instructions of the professor when it comes to how to grade or what to do, so it doesn't really matter how nice she is.\n\r\nProjects\/Homework: You get a project\/homework once every 1-2 weeks, since it takes a while to do.  You get a guideline on what you have to do and you have to use what you have learned from lecture.  This isn't so bad because you have a long time to do it, so you can get help from TAs, the teacher, or friends(sometimes).\n\r\nQuizzes\/Exams: WOW, these things are beyond RIDICULOUS.  For someone who does not have prior programming knowledge, you will NOT finish on time.  In my class, only 1-2 people, who DID have prior programming knowledge, were about to finish in time.  Everyone else did not.  Not only are they badly timed, they are HARD.\n\r\nLike I said earlier, she was the only teacher available for CMSC131, but if you can avoid her, DO SO WITHOUT HESISTATION.  If you aren't a major in computer science, AVOID.  If you can't avoid, you will need to invest an incredulous amount of time if you want an A.  Make sure you get a lot of rest before you enter her class, because she goes through a lot of stuff and she will bore you to sleep.  Her poor speaking skills and habits do not help her either.  It was hard for me to stay interested and awake.","1083":"Other reviews pretty much hit it on the head, so I'm going to let you know that they were right.  At first, she's alright, tolerable, the material is interesting.  And then, just after 'if then' statements, her lectures are off the mark completely.  She zips right through incredibly valuable material with some occasional examples, but nothing near what your then supposed to be able to...code... in your own project.  I emailed her several times with the most unhelpful condensed reply I've ever seen, as if I was wasting her time.  If you haven't had background experience, she is brutal.  She puts questions on the exams that are a harder evolution of an unexplained example in class.\r\nOh, and yes, \"Office Hours\" IS a 'barrage of chaos', 50 kids to one TA.  A real shame to have this class the first experience that CS majors get.","1084":"This being my first computer science class, at Maryland or anywhere, I didn't come in with any idea of what a computer science class would be like. I thought overall Jan Plane was a successful professor - I learned a lot, and got a lot of good practice for programming. The lectures started off interesting, but as time passed they became less and less, but make sure you keep paying attention, because otherwise you'll suddenly have a ton of information to catch up on without much to draw from, other than going to the TAs for help. \r\nShe has a lot of metaphors for the programming, and the usefulness of those vs. the amount they might just confuse you is definitely up in the air.\r\nThe tests weren't too bad at all, but like I said if there's a topic you don't really feel that comfortable with writing code on, make sure you fix that because chances are there'll be a test problem that has you writing code on that.\r\nFor the projects she was very helpful, always willing to look through your code to see what the problem was, which was immensely helpful, but make sure you start the projects early or you'll find yourself having to put hours and hours in the few days before it's due. ","1085":"She is simply not a good teacher. The projects are the majority of the grade, but the examples she provides in class are inadequate. Therefore I've had to rely heavily on my programming experience from high school. The last few projects are a little hard even for me, so imagine how hard it must be for someone with no previous experience. If you have never programmed before, don't expect to pass her class unless you're prepared to invest a truly incredible portion of your time into it.  ","1086":"At the start, this class was quite simple to understand, all the concepts were basic and taught at a steady pace that was optimal for understanding the material.  A few weeks in, however, I, being the very-limited-knowledge-in-computer-science person that I am, was overwhelmed.  Seemingly infinite material is provided in a matter of a few weeks, and if you're not extremely diligent and nearly obsessive about learning the material, you'll most likely have trouble here.  \n\r\nLectures rarely helped where they needed to (projects, quizzes, etc.)\r\nQuizzes were harder than you could imagine, rarely would anyone pass them (besides the ones that have been programming for 5+ years...).\r\nProjects were just as frustrating - and when you try to go in for help, you're met with this barrage of chaos, stuck in a void where the TAs only meet with you for less than five minutes.  Really, you could learn more about computer programming from the textbook, or any other equally equipped textbook.  \n\r\nIf you're not a Computer Science major or don't have an extremely high interest in Computer Science, save yourself the trouble, money, and credits and don't take this course.  If you do...you've been forewarned.","1087":"not a bad lecturer, but not great either. this was my first programing course ever, so i was in the deep end early. she explains every thing, but if you zone out, even for a minute, you are gonna be lost for the next half hour. if you already know about programing, than you probably dont even need to go, as the slides are online","1088":"Not a very good teacher, bad jokes, only went when there was a review, and even those weren't helpful. Final was pretty rough.","1089":"sucks at teaching, corny jokes, just sucks","1090":"Good personality with a great sense of humor but that\u2019s about it. Complaints: \r\n+ His project descriptions do not flow well at all. They often have grammatical errors and information seems to be scattered all over the place, making projects very intimidating for beginners. Explanations do not make much sense at all unless you\u2019re proficient with programming. Instructions for projects are simply horrible to say the least. Either too much info scattered throughout or too little. You\u2019ll spend a lot of time trying to figure out what exactly it is you have to do, unless you\u2019re already good at coding. \r\n+ His lectures are all over the place. Every minute, he interrupts himself to tell someone to stop talking (even if they weren\u2019t talking). For us beginners, it doesn\u2019t help that he keeps doing that. He should just focus on his presentation and teach us the lectures without interruption. \r\nIf you\u2019re good at coding, take his class. He\u2019s funny and makes class fun. But if you\u2019re new to coding, be careful. His projects will give you constant headaches, and you\u2019ll waste a ton of time trying to make sense of the project briefings. ","1091":"Amazing professor! Keeps the class entertaining while teaching the material in a well paced manner. ","1092":"He's a good professor but his projects can be kind of difficult. His exams are somewhat manageable, but the time crunch makes it a race to see who can scribble code the fastest. His lectures are okay but at least he tries his best to make the course interesting. \r\n\r\nI would recommend Pugh to you if you have had some coding experience before, but if you don't, just a warning that it may be a bit too difficult. ","1093":"Terrible lecturer","1094":"extremely smart professor, but not best at lecturing. would highly recommend if you have a little coding background; you'l learn a lot","1095":"Really nice guy. Co-taught CMSC131 with Dr. Pugh this past semester and didn't lecture much but still was active in teaching the course. I'm confident he'll do a great job teaching 131 next semester.","1096":"The worst thing about Nelson is that his jokes get really old.","1097":"Take his class if you have programming background before. You will learn a lot if you know what is going on. Really a knowledgeable and talented professor but not good at lecturing. ","1098":"Very nice & helpful","1099":"Class wasn't too boring for an intro course. He tried his best to teach to the lowest common denominator, since it is an intro course. Grading is fair, didn't always know everything in lecture but he tried his best to answer what he could. ","1100":"Extremely hard working TA, goes to great lengths to ensure you understand concepts. Great at explaining stuff, and genuinely cares about her students.","1101":"I had him for 131 and did not learn a single thing except how is made world a better place, how is a influential person in many things. He should not be teaching 131 at all. This class needs a person who actually teaches.  ","1102":"Really nice guy. Dr. Eastman is always looking for ways to help students learn the material well. Would definitely recommend.","1103":"Humorous and engaging, would for sure take again. ","1104":"Great TA, super helpful; went above and beyond to help us understand content","1105":"Best TA","1106":"Ana was a great TA and was always very helpful during office hours and discussion. She always responded to emails quickly and was patient with her students and wanted them to learn the material so they can succeed in the course.","1107":"Helpful and quiet, informative. ","1108":"Humorous, gives good advice, understanding of the frustrations of being a compsci student","1109":"Outstanding TA","1110":"An alright professor, he jumps into 132 concepts a bit sometimes and expects you to know them for the tests. Also, one annoying part was we went over this basic programming language (basically elementary java) called Processing for over HALF of the semester which was really annoying, made me want to transition into Eclipse ASAP, as much as I hate to say it. Otherwise, Eastman's a nice person and good to talk to if you need help.","1111":"AVOID HIM IF YOU CAN, worst professor ever, you barely learn, exams get a tad harder near the end of course, and the clicker quizzes were so pointless and literally the only reason I bothered to show up to his lectures. Anyone I took to watch his lectures with me all said that it was the worst lecture they'd ever been to, one of them chose Kruskal over him for his 351 class after he watched in on my 131 lectures.","1112":"She's a little timid at first, but she truly is a great TA. She is great at explaining things and she makes sure to ask if any students have questions or if anything is confusing. She is also very patient. Any student would be lucky to have her as a TA. (: ","1113":"amazing TA, always eager to help out during class and leads great reviews for the material we do in lecture. Quizzes are sometimes tough but I don't think she makes them.","1114":"Hosts CMSC131 review sessions, seemingly of his own volition. Really helpful, great at answering questions.","1115":"Really, super nice. He's very excited and enthusiastic about teaching which is great.","1116":"I work for him and he cares so much about his students and TAs","1117":"Saadiq is great! He is very clear with his explanation, and he was able to successfully help me debug 99% of my coding error. Overall, he is a great TA, and I highly suggest you switch into a discussion with him as the TA. ","1118":"Incredible TA. Very clear when he teaches a concept and tries to help anyone that does not understand. Easy to approach and very friendly person. Holds reviews before tests that are extremely helpful and posts practice tests with answers.","1119":"Awesome TA. Answers questions very quickly and gives a clear response. Holds review sessions with another TA and helps him create practice exams. Approachable and friendly.","1120":"A grade A TA. He also writes this website.","1121":"Fawzi's way of explaining the material really makes it stick. I'm not sure what it is. He just makes you see why a concept is useful or why it matters and the explains it in a logical manner. Everything just clicks. ","1122":"This guy is both hilarious and very passionate about teaching. My favourite teacher so far! Take him whenever you can","1123":"Awesome TA! Funny, explains things well and also gives general advice about the major!","1124":"Extremely helpful when asked. Very friendly TA!","1125":"Amazing professor! So friendly and approachable. He really cares about his students and listens to our concerns. He's also really excited about the topic which makes the lecture a lot more interesting to attend.","1126":"Explained concepts really well and was lots of fun too. Take his section if you can.","1127":"Super helpful and easy to understand! A p funny guy who knows his stuff","1128":"Great prof, he's very enthusiastic about CS. He also cares a lot about is students and their success in the course. Definitely wouldn't mind taking CMSC 131 with him again.","1129":"Excellent lecturer! This was my favorite class to go to. The projects are interesting the exams were not too bad. Take that with a grain of salt since I have programmed before. He posts weekly study questions and those are the guide to acing the exams. ","1130":"He's a solid professor. He does everything he can to help his students. Great sense of humor. Does tend to lose his place sometimes during lecture but he's great overall. His practice exams look very much like the actual exams given. ","1131":"Professor Yoon is very respectful and does his best to teach the class fairly. Some of the projects\/labs can get a bit difficult but there are countless office hours to get help and he often extends the deadline if the students feel that it is too hard. Despite this, his lectures are clear and helpful, and CMSC131 is completely doable with Yoon.","1132":"Not a great lecturer, but cares about students","1133":"Professor Yoon is a nice and careful lecturer. He provides enough time and hints for us to work on our projects and labs. However, he is not good at lecturing. So, if you do not have prior coding experience like me, you need to teach yourself to keep the pace with his lectures.\r\n","1134":"A really nice guy and great professor. He really cares about students. Definitely recommend going to his office hours to talk to him about anything.","1135":"Professor Nayeem is pretty good. He's always willing to answer questions and speaks in a clear voice.\r\nOccasionally, it seems as if he accidentally leaves out small details that are important to the concept he is explaining.\r\n\r\nI'd recommend that if you take him, don't be afraid to ask questions and keep doing so until you understand the concept, he is very approachable.","1136":"Fantastic professor, he is very engaging and pretty funny. The course (CMSC131) covers a lot of ground, so things move very fast-paced, but Fawzi does a great job covering everything. Study Questions are great for exam preparation (but not sufficient alone). Projects are not too difficult but become increasingly more time-consuming as the semester progresses, thus starting early is a good idea. Exams are very fair, not too difficult, not too easy. Things that are passed by in lecture may show up on the exam, so it is a good idea to make it to every lecture and take detailed notes. Definitely practice writing chunks of code on paper if you are not used to it, those are usually the most difficult portions of the exams and you won't have a lot of time to think of how to go about the problem, so it's important to know your approach immediately. Do the labs, the code that you have to write in those often resemble the code problems on the exams. Fawzi is superb at explaining abstract concepts and their practicality. The class is not an \"easy A\", but if you put in the work then you should be fine and will certainly learn a lot. The man is good at his job.","1137":"Great professor if you have background with Java. Not so great if you know nothing, but I already knew Java and he only furthered my understanding of programming concepts and how to more effectively use Java.","1138":"One of the best computer science instructors I have ever had. He is extremely organized, and is great at explaining new topics in lecture. He is enthusiastic when teaching and wants to see you succeed. I would prioritize signing up for his class over anyone else. ","1139":"I had to take Evan Golub for CMSC131 because I am international student and the seats for Fawzi Emad (Best CS Prof) were full. Its pretty much the same as his other negative reviews for 131 where his lectures are boring and off-topic, doesn't help you prepare for the exam, weird grading criteria, stupid clickers, laughs at his own jokes!! ","1140":"Fawzi is a good lecturer, has good explanations. He is sometimes rude to students, specifically women, in lecture and in office hours.","1141":"My only prior experience to CS was Programming 1 my senior year of HS, and all those topics were covered within the first two weeks of CMSC131 so everything was fairly new. \r\n\r\nNelson is an incredible professor! He makes the lecturers funny and engages with his students. He really cares for his students and extends projects when he sees fit. Sometimes there are 1 point assignments to boost your grade a little. His lectures are posted online but I highly recommend going to class and then going home to rewatch the lecture and taking notes. I did this for the final exam and scored really high that I wished I did this throughout the semester so that I wouldn't have been crying about the projects. Projects are hard but people are willing to help!! His exams and quizzes are no surprise if you studied and dedicate time for the materials.\r\n\r\nI ended up with an A- in the class with the small curve. I highly recommend Nelson!","1142":"Everything I want to say has already been said by all the 5-star ratings of Fawzi Emad! This man is an enthusiastic, organized, well-spoken professor who is passionate about whatever he teaches. Of course, if you don't put effort into reviewing concepts and doing the CS projects early, your grade will reflect that. \r\n\r\nI liked his teaching style. Very straightforward and to the point, plus his humor to enhance the learning environment. Fawzi is surely the way to go when deciding which professor to learn from! In fact, I'm taking him again for CMSC132 and CMSC250 this semester :)","1143":"He was the best professor of CMSC131 at the semester I took it. He is a nice guy. He allows using laptops for taking notes. He answers questions from the class.\r\nHe is good at explaining various concepts clearly, using terminologies. Only he is not very good at making analogies. If you consider analogies essential for explaining concepts in computer science, you may not like his explanations.","1144":"Don't know why a lot of people hate on Nelson. He's an awesome professor and I thought he explained things to beginner programming students very well compared to other 131 professors. I had experience in Java before coming in, so I didn't have to study as much I guess. I would recommend Nelson over Herman any day. He does make some weird jokes here and there, but if you have at least a little sense of humor, the 75-minute lectures fly by.","1145":"Lived up to the hype. Great and engaging lecturer who cares about his students (overused some jokes, though). Other reviews mention grammatical errors in project specifications, but this was not my experience. Receptive to student concerns.","1146":"A very dedicate professor, who always tries his best to help students to understand lessons.","1147":"This guy...let me tell you...this guy has dedication to his students! He stays over his hours to help anyone who still needs help! Probably the most clever TA of the staff. Sad he will not be able to TA after he graduates, he knows how to reeeeeeech deeeeeeese keeeeeeeds!","1148":"Hands down best TA out there. Goes above and beyond to help students, dedicates time outside of class to hold 3 hour review sessions and practice exams, answers ALL questions, and simply cares a lot about student success.","1149":"Amazing TA!! He actually cares about your success and answers any questions you have. Even though he wasn\u2019t a teaching TA, his office hours really helped me get a better understanding of the content and projects!","1150":"Although his teaching style is not that good and lectures are very hard to understand sometimes, Yoon has a great personality. The projects in this class can be hard, but he tries his best to make sure everyone knows what they have to do. Finally, the best thing about Yoon is that he makes big fair, curves in the class as a whole.","1151":"I thought he was fine for 131. Lectures aren't great, frequently goes off-topic. Kind during office hours. If you have prior programming expierence you'll be fine.  If you don't then develop a hand in Java before starting 131.","1152":"Yoon wasn't an amazing attention grabber during lecture but he taught the class really well. The projects really helped with learning the material and starting with Processing before Java was such a great idea. Overall highly recommend his class for beginners and experienced people alike.","1153":"Great Lecturer","1154":"Trust these reviews. Fawzi knows how to teach CS to beginners unlike any other professor in the department. I came in with absolutely no knowledge of Java and got an A+. By no means is his 131 class easy, conversely it is actually very difficult. I am a business major adding CS and this was definitely the hardest class I've ever taken. You need to work really hard and study literally every day to do well in this course. Fawzi is an astounding lecturer and if you sit in the front, ask questions, and take notes on everything he says, you can do well. Fawzi is miles better than any other professor (including Nelson\/Pedram) for CMSC131. Take  him!","1155":"Fawzi is pretty overrated. Maybe it's just me since everyone else seems to love him, but he was under-prepared for class almost every single lecture. Maybe its because I was his first class of the day, not entirely sure, but he'd frequently forget about slides or not have materials ready. His lecturing style was alright, but nowhere near as phenomenal as people make it out to be.","1156":"Fawzi is AMAZING! I don't see how anybody could give him a negative review. He is a true professional who loves teaching and cares deeply about his students. He's the best natural \"teacher\" I've ever had (including college and high school). The lectures were informative and held my attention the whole time. He was also very helpful and encouraging to me during office hours.  I wish I could take another class with Fawzi!","1157":"Very good lecturing. It helped that he was co-lecturing with nelson so I think the exams were easier.","1158":"Great TA and easy to talk to. He would take time after lab to talk to me about jobs and future classes too which I really liked.","1159":"Perfect, approachable, answers questions, funny, and commands classroom ","1160":"I was worried taking this class with basically no cs experience, but fawzi definitely made everything feel doable. His lectures are great and because of the way his slides are made, you HAVE to attend every lecture if you don\u2019t have a strong background. His quizzes are also very easy but he doesn\u2019t drop so you have to make sure you go to every lecture and consistently stay up to date with his study questions. The two midterms are almost entirely straightforward questions and are very simple to study for by looking at past quizzes\/study questions. The projects are easy A\u2019s if you start them the day you\u2019re assigned, which I made a habit.\r\n\r\nOverall, this class was the most time consuming class I\u2019ve had so far, but also one where I learned the most. I definitely recommend taking fawzi, as I believe you\u2019ll learn the most from him.","1161":"I had Golub for 131 and 351. I disliked him for 131, as I was just learning CS and his lectures were very rambling and not very useful. His slides are not that great when he has them, so you really have to pay attention. Despite these complaints I did learn stuff in his lecturers and I think I got the correct grades for the amount of work I put in. For 351 he was great mainly because he was much easier than Kruskal. His tests were very fair in that class and were very similar to the homeworks and lectures. I would recommend Golub for upper level courses, but maybe avoid him for earlier courses, as his non-sequiturs can be really frustrating when you are first learning certain concepts.  ","1162":"Take nelson.","1163":"He's a good person, but an okay teacher. He lectures every class, but rarely stays on topic. If you know basic Java already you are probably better off taking his class because it will be so easy and minimal work. He does clickers, but it is really just for attendance. So you will have to show up to his class, but do nothing in it. His exams are tough-ish. Its more because he likes to test on the stuff he said once. ","1164":"I'm an international student. My native language is not English. And I have to say, if you don't have any background on coding or if you are not an English native speaker, DO NOT TAKE Nelson because he has a thick Spanish accent. It sounds like he was shooting a machine gun. DADADADADA. ","1165":"AMAZING professor. Clearly always prepared for his lectures, makes everything understandable and attention-holding, and easy to talk to. Great class even if you haven't done CS before. Overall, I had a great time in his classes (took CMSC131 and 132 with him). Projects are doable and interesting but will take time. He also has pop quizzes (better in 131 than 132 there). I learned so much from him!!","1166":"Nelson is a funny guy who makes a lot of jokes, but I didn't really learn that much from him.  I wish I had taken the course with the other instructor.","1167":"Such an awesome teacher for 131 and 132. He's fun and fair, and he's a good lecturer that makes sure you understand the material\u2013as long as you pay attention during his lectures and show up, you can do really well in the class.\r\n\r\nHe also let me take my first 131 exam in his office after I accidentally slept through it, so I pretty much owe this man my life.","1168":"This man knows how to keep the class engaged, and he's absolutely hilarious. Projects and exams are kind of difficult though, so make sure to really get the material down.","1169":"Hardest thing ive ever done in my life. It started soooo slow but then it got extremely hard extremely fast and ruthless after learning about objects. Nelson is cool but not for this class.","1170":"He's good at explaining concepts. It is a bit distracting when he talks to his students in the recordings (class was asynchronous so we only watched recordings of previous lectures), but it helps with having a mini break in between. His accent is a bit challenging at times, so do not rely on the auto-generated captions. Open to help on Piazza and usually assigns enough time for projects, but you will most likely be directed to a TA for help. He gives lots of time to complete quizzes.","1171":"The actual GOAT. I have minimal background programming experience and took this class to see if I enjoyed CS. Fawzi was a great professor with a great sense of humor and very fair exams\/quizzes. He taught me so much about CS and I am very glad I took it with him, plan on taking 132 with him next semester to. If you can, take Fawzi.","1172":"Really enjoyed his class - though lectures were recorded online, I was never bored when watching them, plus he makes the content really easy to understand for a beginner CS course; plus, quizzes + projects were not bad - would definitely reccommend!","1173":"Phoebe is the best TA that I've had yet. She is insanely nice, helpful and very good at teaching class. She is very approachable with any issues you might have. ","1174":"Fawzi was a solid professor with quality lectures and enjoyable, reasonable projects. His lectures were asynchronous and you had all day to watch them, which was convenient. If you enjoy challenges, then I guarantee you will like his Soldiers project which was a lot of fun to work with. The biggest downside is that his quizzes are little tough and can be tight on time. He also comes off a bit rude in his class-wide emails, however whenever I personally emailed him, he was receptive and kind.","1175":"He''s a great professor and all his lectures explain the concepts thoroughly. During COVID his lectures are recorded and it mandatory to watch for a grade. He posts them a day early.  His exams and quizzes are timed. He makes silly jokes in his lecture and overall, I definitely recommend him as a professor for this class. ","1176":"I took Fawzi for 131 and will be taking him again for 132 in the spring. He is a great lecturer, explaining concepts well and then illustrating them with examples. He also keeps them fairly entertaining (which is hard to do with pre-recorded lectures, I'm sure his in-person classes are even better). All of the projects were fairly straightforward and most of the time you end up with a cool final product.  If you watch all his lectures and study your lecture notes, you'll do fine on quizzes\/exams. He covers everything that winds up on his tests in his lectures.\r\n","1177":"Nelson does a great job of making a potentially boring class, extremely fun. He explains the concepts well and adds in humor to make it bearable. This class is a lot of work, of course, but here are a lot of ways to get help if you need it. I am going to take his classes as many times as I possibly can.","1178":"I am a rising senior in CS and Fawzi is one of the best teachers that I have had alongside Teli. He explains the concepts well and is good at gauging what a freshman understands better than Yoon. You can't go wrong with taking him or Nelson. ","1179":"Solid lecturer, though wouldn't recommend taking him if you don't do well under pressure due to the time constraints he had for tests\/quizzes.","1180":"His lectures (which were asynchronous) were always out in a timely manner, and when they weren't he would give you an extra two or three days to watch them. His lectures were not only well-taught and understandable but also entertaining, as he constantly cracks jokes. He is also very responsive to emails.","1181":"I had Fawzi for 131 last semester and he did an outstanding job. I really felt like I learned the material completely. I can't recommend him enough.","1182":"brilliant TA, deserves prizes in the form of candy BOMBS. he's so good, he spent a lot of time with me helping me perfect my projects take it with him if you have the chance!!!","1183":"Good lecturer, although he gave less time than some other professors for quizzes and exams which made them somewhat difficult.","1184":"One of the best CS professors out there. Yes the class is difficult but Nelson tried to make the material as understandable as possible. \r\nBut halfway through the semester the course feels like it suddenly sped up, so you need to stay on your game the whole time or you will get overwhelmed by new material fast.","1185":"Definitely one of the best professors at UMD especially because of how easy and fun he makes the lectures. He is the only professor that I have this semester whose class just seems to effortless and fun. Nelson seems more like a friend than a teacher - a great quality for someone looking to be mentored.","1186":"I took 131 with no coding experience during Spring 21 sem. His class was extremely difficult for me because of the difference in content covered on exams vs in the lectures. Projects and exams took me all day and I struggled really hard with this class. You won't interact with him at all so be prepared to teach yourself and always attend discussion.","1187":"Just finishing up the semester and had to give Nelson a review. Out of my 3 semesters here, he\u2019s easily one of the best professors I\u2019ve ever had.\r\n\r\nNot only is he hilarious, but he also keeps his lectures engaging, and really tries to get his students to understand what is going on. I have had no actual prior programming experience before coming into this class, and I was able to pick up on concepts really easily, especially with all the examples he hands out. The projects definitely get challenging near the end, but you have plenty of time to finish them and the TA\u2019s can be very helpful. This is not the easiest class, and it definitely has a decent workload, but it was overall enjoyable and a great start towards a computer science degree. Also: HE RECORDS LECTURES! It\u2019s really useful. Fawzi doesn\u2019t to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nSome of these 1 star reviews are upsetting me so here\u2019s what I have to say:\r\n- His accent is so slight that you can understand everything he is saying just fine, and his occasional grammatical errors are not at all confusing, just read over the sentence again.\r\n- While this class does get harder as it goes along, as long as you pay attention a good 80% of the time and keep with the work, there is no way you would be able to call this class impossible.\r\n- As far as CMSC131 and CMSC132 go, I have heard that Nelson is one of the easier professors.\r\n- He definitely does more than read his slides. He shows several examples of code for each topic\r\n- He isn\u2019t a big fan of when people talk loudly in his class, but he\u2019s cool about it. I talked with my friend everyday in that class at a low volume and he didn\u2019t mind at all.\r\n- He will ask you to clarify your questions if he doesn\u2019t understand, so be sure to be clear about your issues. The TA\u2019s will help you if he can\u2019t.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend if you want to go into CS, take Nelson.","1188":"Absolute King of a prof. He's as funny as he is knowledgeable, and is an all-around great choice. His lectures are entertaining and informative, and he will pause periodically and wait for someone to raise their hand. After each lecture, he'll post his slides and any code he used in class as examples. As someone who's had a few years of experience in Java, the projects are challenging but always fair and well-implemented (and there's always a TA who can help you). Each week, he'll post practice questions that he'll occasionally directly copy onto quizzes and exams. The quizzes are easy but frequent enough that you're always forced to keep up with the information. The exams can be challenging but are never impossible. In each discussion section, he'll give a lab that is very reflective of any quiz or exam coding questions. \r\n\r\nOverall, Fawzi makes you want to learn and understand the info and I can't recommend him enough. ","1189":"Nelson is clearly a super caring guy. He acknowledges the difficulty of CS and wants everyone to do well. His lectures are also great and he keeps you engaged with jokes and stories. Some people complain that the jokes and stories are a distraction, but they made me more engaged. Just make sure you don't blank out during lectures as you can miss important info. Projects and exams can be tricky, so make sure you are on top of everything. I came in with coding experience so I was fine, but I saw a ton of my friends really struggle.","1190":"Okay, so Nelson is a very nice guy, and if you ask for an extension on a project he normally gives it to you but tbh he isn't a good professor. I would not recommend this class to anyone who hasn't taken any programming classes before. This class is super fast-paced and if you fall behind you'll be lost. This class is extremely hard, the tests are what most people fail at because of how hard he makes them. He gives you previous exams to practice but the questions he asks on the exam are totally different. I am talking about studying for 4 days straight and still failing kinda hard. On one exam everyone did bad on and he still didn't curve it or find a way to help us out because of how badly it affected our grades. The projects aren't totally awful until you get near the end of the semester, I would say you are working on a project every day of the week through the semester. But most people do better on the projects than on the exams and that's what helps your grade. There are certain TA's that aren't really much help and it's so difficult to make a meeting with a TA for no reason. I have never seen so many people struggle with one class until I took CMSC131. I really don't recommend this class to anyone and if I could go back in time and not take this class I would. This class ruined my first semester of freshman year. ","1191":"IF YOU HAVE NEVER CODED THIS CLASS IS HARDD!!!!\r\n\r\nAdvice for Class:\r\nThere is no way around it, this class is difficult for those with no prior experience or who it doesn't come naturally. Nelson is a decent teacher, but be prepared that he moves really fast. \r\nYour first 2-3 weeks of semester should just be spent constantly coding small tasks to get familiar with java and eclipse. It will help so much. Also watch YouTube vids to try to get ahead.   The tests are hard as well so prepare early to write your code instead of type. The previous tests he gives as examples are ALWAYS much easier then actual test, so know \/ understand them like the back of your hand. The projects help you learn the most because they take HOURS. I would have the expectation that each one will take at least 8 hours. start them as soon as they are released and bounce ideas of friends as much as you can. DO NOT CHEAT OR SHOW CODE to others.  the TAs will notice if you copy. Just explain what you did and how in words and you should be okay. Use your peers as support in this class because it is easy to get stuck. \r\n\r\nNelson review:\r\nHe is good teacher will slight accent and decent humor. overall is nice and down to earth(insists you call him nelson). His lectures are not the most organized and he tends to bounce around which can be confusing. Luckily you can watch them back and try to understand.  He is relatively accessible in office hours, but tends to come off as an overpowering personality in person. I suspect this is because he lectures groups more then teaches individuals. I also think he knows this and try's to improve(only somewhat successful).  I am trying to take him next semester for 132. He is defiantly not perfect, but he is far better then some other shit teachers at UMD. \r\n\r\nPs. People tend to vary in their liking of him because of how much they enjoy his humor in lectures. \r\n","1192":"I LOVED FAWZI! He is the best CS professor you can ask for! His lecture is fun and easy to understand, his quizzes and exams are super easy. And he will give you a head start on the upper-level course, so it will be easier when you get to the higher-level CS course! !! There are also chances for you to be engaged in competition in his course where he will give out prizes to you and make you feel like a STAR! ! ! ALSO, his projects are super easy and some you can even put on your resume! ","1193":"I've never taken a coding class in my life, but I just tried to understand some basics of Java over the summer. However, I didn't really get that far. I was really stressed about taking CMSC131, in fact, I was constantly asking people at UMD how difficult it was for a newbie programmer to adjust to the class before I came here. CMSC131 will take a lot of work and time management, but it is do-able, especially if you have Nelson. He's a great teacher who cares for his students and is willing to be accommodating towards them (deadline extensions, cancellations of quizzes, etc.). He gives you all of the resources you need to do well in his class.  I haven't taken the final yet, but so far, I believe that every test and project we've been given has been fair. He is a example-based lecturer and it works perfectly with my style of learning, but make sure this style fits you if you want to take him.\r\nThat said, you will only do well in this class without any previous experience if you are willing to put in the effort. Start projects early and go to TA office hours to clear concepts up. Spend a few days studying for each midterm and make sure to do all the practice exams that you are given. Reach out for help using the free I4C tutoring service or talk directly to Nelson.  ","1194":"Nelson is awesome, I swear he is the ideal professor for students who have no CS experience, especially those who are worried about jumping into CS without an understanding of what the major really is. Nelson creates a great environment with humor and takes time to reassure you that CS is not as intimidating as people make it to be. While you do need to be willing to put in the work, he is the most accommodating and patient instructor I've had because he really does care about his students needs. I will definitely be trying my best to take as many classes with the instructor in the future! ","1195":"Nelson is a goofball for real - \r\nMy first ever programming class, and I learned a ton, and ended with a good, fair grade. I could find Nelson to be irritating though, if I don't understand a topic, he tends to joke a lot. But he made the class fun, projects were fair (most the time), and the workload was not too bad. \r\nIssues: Spelling\/grammar mistakes in project descriptions, discussions being useless","1196":"Compared to Pedram, who I had for the same course, Fawzi taught this better in almost every way. He's very enthusiastic, makes jokes, and really tries to make sure the class understands difficult concepts before moving on. For really difficult things, he'll always tell you if it is testable material. Besides that, his quizzes are generally easy, projects can be finished in a couple of days, and the exams are fair. Also, this TAs this semester were very helpful whenever I did have problems with a project.\r\n\r\nI would recommend choosing him regardless of your experience with Java.","1197":"He is a great professor in the sense that he is funny and tries to keep the class engaged. However, he goes relatively fast throughout the material and it is easy to get lost through the semester. He doesn't give us students enough time to reflect on the material and understand and just keeps going. A lot of the times when I went in for office hours or asked him questions after class, he makes me feel stupid and acts in a way that gives off the vibe that I should already know this. At times he wouldn't even answer the question I had. I have to say though, he is very generous with deadlines and is willing to extend if people request it. He doesn't curve.","1198":"Extremely easy to understand, excellent lecturer, very charismatic, and knowledgeable on the subject. Just all-around an excellent professor. He is incredibly invested in making sure his students understand the concepts, which is why he doesn't allow laptops in any of his lectures, but don't let that scare you off at all. Don't skip a class, start all the projects early, and you will easily pass this class. I will definitely take him for 132 next semester. \r\n\r\nI have heard that he can be very egotistical and arrogant in one-on-one conversations, but that's never happened to me. ","1199":"Nelson is a great professor, he tries to keep lectures interesting with jokes and takes small breaks every 10 minutes for the class to ask each other questions or just talk. He is good at keeping everyone interacting with each other and encourages people to talk and get to know each other. However, the course, in general, is very difficult, if you have not taken any Computer science courses before, this course is very challenging. I know people who have barely passed this class as they have had no experience, and since this class is fast-paced it is really hard to keep learning new material while also doing the projects. I would really recommend coming in with some level of experience and looking over material that is covered in this class before taking this course.","1200":"Context: Programmed in Java through an intro to java course in HS as well as APCS A (Not principles).\r\n\r\nHonestly, if given the choice between Fawzi and Nelson, I would recommend you take Nelson. BE PREPARED to spend time outside of class learning, digesting, and applying the information taught in class as I felt like Nelson was quick with the material during the lecture. Sources like Alex Lee or w3schools really helped me out when I was lost within the material. Especially with me coming in with prior knowledge of Java and programming, this course definitely challenges you in a good way. Be sure to manage your time well, start your projects early, and always ask questions. If you have no experience programming before, you're going to have to spend a lot of time reviewing and learning the material for the first time as it's a lot, especially with the pace. I believe my grade within the class was fair, as I know I could've applied myself more to fully understand the material. This class should be on your higher level of priority (The same level\/effort as MATH140 for me at least). In the end, I learned a lot from Nelson and do not regret taking the class with him.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- Recorded Lectures\r\n- Lectures, programs, and in-class notes are always posted online\r\n- Provides sample exams\/quizzes for students to prepare for prior to midterms\/finals.\r\n- Allows you to have your laptop out during class (NOTE: I have heard that Fawzi does NOT allow laptops out during class).\r\n- Always understanding\/flexible with scheduling conflicts --> not afraid to move assignment\/test deadlines further when asked\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Can be fast with the material he goes through\r\n- (Did not bother\/affect me at all) Has a slight accent\r\n- (To some people this might be a con) Brief moments during class to reflect what was learned to classmates + ask questions\r\n- Sometimes he can joke around too much to the point where it'll take away from the class time (Did not annoy me, a review from someone earlier mentioned this and I also believe it's true).\r\n- Does not use Canvas. Nelson uses his own website for posting projects details, slides, sample programs, etc...\r\n- (Not a con for me) Uses Piazza for class announcements + addressing student questions\/concerns\/memes (yes there is a meme folder for the class, pretty dope).","1201":"Nelson is great!!! If you're the type of person to get kind of bored during boring old slide lectures then he's good for you! He relies on examples in the lecture and a few small concepts from the slides. He gives us one-minute breaks in between heavy topics\/examples so that we can discuss it with our neighbors, which I find really helpful in keeping everyone interactive and actually paying attention esp in a morning class. His exams are doable as long as you do the past exams\/practice he gives which is really helpful. His third exam; however, was overly long and challenging compared to his others so it tanked a lot of people's grades, but he just released grades and seemed to have provided a better cutoff to benefit (f.e. some A grades were considered A+ and so on), so as long as you put the work in you should be golden in terms of your grade (it's not meant to be challenging to get an A or B). Also, his projects are definitely on the challenging side sometimes especially later in the year with Recursion and the class implementations, but if you study his class lecture code and ask for help during office hours (always go early otherwise you probably won't get a chance if it's close to the project deadline). Overall, he explains things effectively for the most part and I'd recommend reading some notes on the topics before coming into class on the first day just so you have a good idea of what coding in Java is about and you aren't bombarded too fast! He does not curve, but his grades are pretty fair. I really enjoyed his class and it's insane to me how much I learned in just three months! I totally recommend Nelson","1202":"I\u2019m glad I chose Fawzi for 131, and I would take him again for 132 if my schedule allowed me to do so.\r\n\r\nAs a beginner, I felt like his lectures were effective because his teaching style somehow got the material to stick in my head. He is straight to the point, but also occasionally throws in some humor to keep the class engaged. Lectures never really felt rushed, I think he was good at time management and knew when to cut off a lecture to not rush a topic. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m not really sure if he has office hours, but TA hours (from 9-6) were a godsend. I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve passed this class without his TAs. The TAs were helpful for getting me through the projects, but they also seemed to help other students with any questions about course content. \r\n\r\nThere were 2 major exams throughout the semester and 1 final. I thought they were all fair questions - study the study questions and notes from lecture, as well as last quizzes. Quizzes were basically weekly and also fair. The front of the worksheet was usually multiple choice or short answer questions, and the back was a coding question, and you had 20 minutes to do the quiz.","1203":"public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n\/*\r\nNelson is a great professor. He is really laid back, chill, and constantly makes jokes and finds interesting ways to keep students engaged. This was my first time coding in Java and Nelson made it very straight forward and doable.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- Nelson is a very funny and likable guy. On the first day of classes he will tell you that he always wants you to call him by his first name which I found interesting.\r\n- He is very good at making analogies between programming and more understandable topics. For example, he would make an analogy between a bakery and objects in java. This makes it really easy to understand his teaching, even for first time programmers like me.\r\n- His lecture slides are much more detailed than Fawsi's (from what I have heard)\r\n- His exams are very much like the previous exams. As long as you study those, and the additional resources that Nelson provides, you will be more than fine on the exams.\r\n- Occasionally during every lecture, Nelson likes to say \"1 minute\" which indicates that we can talk to our neighbor for a minute and digest the information that he just lectured about. I found this useful and made the class less fast paced\u2014 gave me time to breathe while learning new information. After this minute break, he opens the floor for a few questions before returning to his lecture.\r\n- Nelson uploads the code for every class example and provides many many resources to ensure you do well on the projects and exams.\r\n- Grading for exams is honestly pretty lenient. Because all the midterms include hand-written coding, it is easy to miss the small nuances that come with programming but the TAs that grade your tests know this. Often times when you look at the grading break down, you are given points on a segment of code just for \"ATTEMPTING to _______\"\r\n- Very accommodating in regards to extending deadlines for things. He even encourages that the class speaks up if we need an extension.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- His funny personality sometimes gets in the way of the actual teaching. Yes it does lighten up the mood but often he will stop mid sentence just to pop in a joke. Additionally, some of his comedy is offensive or will get stale. For example, he once made a statement to the guys in the class about how they should not feel bad if a girl rejects them. He then goes on with his joke and says that girls are like \"instance variables\" and how the guys should just \"pick another one\" if one doesn't work. If you know anything about Java, you will know that he basically just called women \"objects\". I didn't think too much about this but I can see why some people would find his humor offensive. He also always makes the joke \"turn to your neighbor and tell them they are a (insert random java terminology)\" which literally makes no sense and gets old after the first couple times.\r\n- The third midterm was a nightmare. In the past, there have only been two midterms and the third was only added a couple years ago. This means that there is little study material and the worst part is that the second and third midterm are only 2 weeks apart since they kind of just shoved it into the curriculum. The class average for midterms is usually pretty high but dropped to a D average for this midterm. Nelson did adjust the letter grade cut offs for final grades because of this though.\r\n- Projects become very challenging towards the end of the semester. This is obviously necessary to challenge students but sometimes they are impossible to figure out without a TA.\r\n- Frankly, sometimes it is difficult to understand his accent and it leaves you to think more about what words he is saying in the first place rather than the actual content within his sentences.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think Nelson is the better option for CMSC131. He is very knowledgable and it is clear that he comes prepared for class with examples to explain complex ideas to new programmers. Just beware of his random remarks. It is clear that he is looking for validation and wants to be liked by his students so he makes jokes on topics that students our age would find \"funny\". If you can get past the cringe factor, this class will great.\r\n*\/\r\nSystem.out.println(\"Chose Nelson!\");\r\n}","1204":"Nelson is a cool professor. I will try to create a pros and cons table for you, the reader, to understand my mind.\r\n\r\n[PROS]\r\n- He's funny.\r\n- Does not require attendance, so you can watch his lecture videos on Canvas. \r\n- Projects are fun.\r\n- He's nice.\r\n[CONS]\r\n- Sometimes the jokes get annoying, especially when you're trying to learn. As stated in other comments, he will sometimes just say jokes randomly (which can be funny at times), but as the days went by the jokes became old.\r\n- You really gotta pay attention if you don't know the material and talk to TAs constantly if you don't know anything. If anything, the TAs are more helpful than Nelson himself.\r\n- As anecdotal evidence, he created a 3rd exam (in the past there were only 2) which covered a bunch of topics. I went to the exam review and the TA told us not to review this one topic. Next thing you know that topic is on the exam!!! I heard that half of the class did POORLY on that exam (including me). I went from a B to a C overnight. \r\n- Projects are fun but require a ton of logic. I had to use external sources to find out topics that I did not understand.\r\n- Exams and quizzes are done on PAPER. You really have to know Java word by word or you are dead. For slow writers, good luck because you only have about 20-40 minutes to do about 3-4 methods.\r\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\r\nIf you do not know Java, LEARN IT prior to taking this class. If you do not have ANY knowledge, you are screwed. Gladly I had some coding knowledge that helped me in the long run. Learn how to code and how to write it. Overall, great class but annoying coursework.","1205":"I think Nelson was a rather good professor, and a good lecturer. He often made jokes and gave people breaks. I must say however, some of the jokes were directed at students (Madison, if you're seeing this, I hope the U.S.S. Nelson didn't hit too hard). If you left class early, he would begin to fake cry, which admittedly was funny, but if you need to leave the class early then just expect that. He would also repeatedly tell people to be quiet, which had interrupted class a fair bit. I also felt some of the multiple choice on the tests were a little random, but other than that, he was really good. He did provide a lot of extensions (which helped a ton of people), and ended up curving the class because of one of the exams having a low average. Take him if you need breaks during lecture, want some extensions, or generally just want a funny professor to laugh with. ","1206":"Nelson does his best to keep the lectures entertaining and tries to adjust deadlines whenever possible. It's a bit hard reaching out to him or his TA for help, but the website he uses along with other instructors takes up most of that. In general you'll be all good if you took a Computer Science that covered the basics beforehand, including the ones in high school. If you're coming to this class with no prior knowledge, you might find yourself lost at some times, as he starts his lectures with the assumption that you already know the basics. You will have a project almost every week, with rising difficulty, so it is highly recommended you start your work as soon as possible. Submitting your projects last minute is difficult, since the website can go down from how many people are doing the same. There is almost no flexibility once the deadline passes, and the late penalty hits hard. Study when you should, don't hesitate to go to office hours, and don't be afraid to reach out for help, as it will be difficult to recover once you fall behind. Don't be afraid to ask for anything, since if it's possible he can push deadlines back by a week, but don't rely on it, since procrastination does hit hard in this class. Otherwise, taking the course with him isn't all too bad.","1207":"Nelson is one of the best cs teachers. period. If you have the option to take him, take him. He makes the course super easy to get through and he's super funny.","1208":"Nelson is good professor, with entertaining lectures that are relatively easy to follow. While CMSC131 is not the most beginner-friendly introductory course, that isn't really a knock on Nelson. He wasn't the most accessible for help at times, but that was the only complaint I had. Overall, still a good professor who I'd take again. ","1209":"Really nice and made class enjoyable to come to","1210":"Fawzi was pretty nice and his TAs were wonderful. I appreciated his teaching style (giving the specifics of each topic we covered) and discussing the concepts before jumping straight into the code. The weekly quizzes were a bit of a drag, but they did make sure that I learned and retained the material. Exams seemed fair and I would've taken him for 132 if I didn't have schedule conflicts.\r\n\r\nDO NOT SKIP CLASS THOUGH! He does not record and the slides are very barebones.","1211":"For a starter course for Computer Science major this Yoon makes this course extremely difficult. I took a bunch of other java coding courses before taking cmsc131 and even then I am struggling. His coding project assignments and labs are fairly easy and you have more than enough time to complete them, but when it comes to quizzes and exams be prepared to fail miserably. I don't remember our class getting more than 70 on average in any of his quizzes or exams. His exams and quizzes are heavy with writing a code on paper and you have no time to finish them. Right now the class average is a failing (even with projects and labs boosting the grades), and exams are not getting any easier. He talks that his course is for people that didn't know how to code before while making exams and quizzes more difficult than they should be like he is mocking you. His practices exams he gives you are also much easier than the exam itself giving you false hope.","1212":"Horrible. No help for students who are behind though attending all lectures. Terrible at responding to students with legitimate problems understanding and doesn't care for the improvement of students. No help from him. Terrible at conveying topics and concepts to students. TA office hours are your best bet at understanding anything. Teach yourself or suffer the consequences.","1213":"I took Fawzi for both CMSC131 and 132 in Fall 2021 and Spring 2022, respectively. He is an amazing lecturer and a \"fair\" professor. 98% of what will be on a test is what he has taught in class, but sometimes throws 1 or 2 multiple choice questions that he briefly mentioned. Moreover, the teacher assistants are super helpful: I can't make it in his class without their support, especially when it's for coding projects and reviewing for midterms (they make review slides and coding examples in my semester, and I hope the next TA will do that too). I never have an office hour with Fawzi, but the TAs are more than enough (he recruits amazing ones). \r\n\r\nThere are 3 advices to give to new students who take his class:\r\n1. DO NOT SKIP CLASS! Fawzi posts lecture slides but most are similar to outlines. To truly understand it, it's better to attend classes and see his thinking processes with examples and drawings. He is strict with time, so he prioritizes delivering all the contents he has for the lecture first then asking questions second.\r\n2. START PROJECTS EARLY! The day Fawzi posts the announcement that the next project is available is the day you should start right away! The TAs are there to help you. Immediately go to them if you don't know how to start. Don't wait until the last 4 days, unless you love being in a long queue of ~20 students (each takes like 5 minutes, give or take another 5).\r\n3. REVIEW LECTURES WEEKLY! Fawzi usually gives weekly quizzes and it's a good way to know what you need to review for midterms. I regret that I didn't do this weekly, which gave me lots of stress the day before the quiz or exam. This not only maintains good scores for all assignments during the semester but also helps you solidify your understanding of all contents for the final.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- Great lectures (easy and clear to understand, good examples)\r\n- Fair exams (what you have learned)\r\n- Supportive, friendly, and super helpful TAs\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Exams: because he tests all of what you have learned (some topics appears a lot and some only appears once), you have no idea what will worth lots of points. You study EVERYTHING, which is just ... a lot.\r\n- He doesn't record lectures (maybe once or twice if it's Friday before a holiday weekend).\r\n- Optional: \"nerds\" who ask a lot of advanced questions at the front and interrupts the lectures.\r\n\r\nPS: I failed the final (D), but all other assignments were high (B+). They balanced out.","1214":"Took cmsc131 from him, at the start of the semester he told the class that this course is for people who had no prior experience in coding. I had 2 almost years of coding experience therefore projects were easy for me but  I struggled in his exams. His exams make no sense at all. He gives 2 to 3 handwriting code questions with the difficulty level of interview questions for a job and expects us to finish it in 50 min with lots of tricky multiply choices questions additional to that. He teaches nothing and expects us to learn from coding ourselves. He curves the class but having the stress is not worth it. I can't believe how stressful his course was. If you want to feel shitty and question whether to major in computer science take him otherwise AVOID him.","1215":"Great professor likes to tell a lot of jokes. Class is easy if taken in high school if not make sure you prepare before you take it. Nelson is a great lecturer also was very helpful by giving online resources such as videos of him lecturing. Also great for freshman cares about his students and wants them to adjust to college.","1216":"I don't know how to even feel about this class, Yoon is a really nice professor but his exams and quizzes are extremely hard. The averages for both the quizzes and the exams are extremely low. He loves to put tricky questions in his exams or quizzes which I extremely hate. For around the second half of the semester I had to basically teach myself or look up concepts that he taught because he overcomplicates them as a professor. He does post lectures + slides online though, and the TAs go through practice exams\/problems in review sessions. A lot of the lectures are all over the place, but feel free to ask him questions during\/after lecture and he'll kindly do so, he's a nice guy. ","1217":"TLDR: boring lectures, hard projects, but nice guy.\r\n\r\nIt me say that if you know what to expect he's not so bad however my first time with him was a bit of a headace.\r\n\r\nHe said his class is beginner friendly which i don't think is true.\r\n(I had a semester of computer science classes at a community college)\r\n\r\nUsing eclipse for the first time was a bit tricky. I wish he had spent more time explaining.\r\nHis projects were a bit on the hard side.\r\n\r\nI often found the descriptions long and vague. things have to be done in a certain way to test certain skills.\r\n\r\nHis exams were a fair although is online exams were just mini projects which were a pain.\r\n\r\nIf you understand the topics then the projects aren't so bad, if you don't you could spend several hours struggling.","1218":"Is he the best lecturer out there? Probably not. But Pedram is an extremely effective lecturer who teaches very clearly if you put in the work required. Starting projects on time, studying properly will make this class very feasible. His exams are extremely fair and his prep\/schedule helps you succeed a lot. He's also a great guy who truly cares about his students... happy to have had him for my intro CS course. ","1219":"Pedrams lectures are very boring, his project descriptions are extremely vague and hard to follow, and his exams are somewhat difficult. In addition, there was plenty of content on the final exam that he only mentioned briefly in class but never went in depth about. He isn't the worst choice, but definitely not great.","1220":"Pedram's exams and quizzes are extremely fair. In particular, his TA's this semester were exceptional. Some advice: start the projects THE DAY THEY ARE ASSIGNED and JOIN A STUDY GROUP!! Overall I had a much better experience taking CMSC131 with him this spring than I had taking CMSC131 with Fawzi in the fall. ","1221":"Yoon\u2019s a great guy and very down-to-earth, but his lectures aren\u2019t rly the best.  If you don\u2019t already have a background in coding, I can understand how this course can be especially difficult (even if it\u2019s supposed to be an intro level course).  If that\u2019s the case, actually going to discussion and office hours can help tremendously bc Yoon or the TAs will look at your code.  ","1222":"Yoon was, quite frankly, not a good professor. For some reason, his 131 curriculum is different than that of the other 131 profs. He begins with Processing, which is basically visual Java and you will never encounter it again afterwards if you complete this class. It was more than halfway into the semester when we finally started doing Object Oriented Programming in Java, whereas with other 131 profs you start Java on day 1. Yoon's quizzes and exams are ridiculously hard for no reason: the multiple choice are usually random programming trivia from class and the coding questions are often curveballs. Pulling up GradeServer, our exam averages were as follows: E1: 68. E2: 59. E3: 61. Final Exam: 56. Such low averages on exams are indicative of one thing: lackluster teaching. There were a few good things worth mentioning throughout the class though. Yoon was quite flexible if you had extenuating circumstances and couldn't get a project in on time, or if some error happened in submissions. Additionally, because the class average was so low at the end of the semester, cutoffs were adjusted and some may argue they were generous (although I would say they were not overly generous, but necessary). I passed with a B+, having a 74 in the class. Try taking any other 131 professor if possible.","1223":"High quality lecturer, posts lecture videos to Panopto. He explains the important concepts in detail. He explains code visually using drawings, which made sense for me since I am a visual learner. \r\n\r\nExams are fair and are reflective of the material he emphasizes in both lecture and discussion. A few days before the exam he will give the topics and hints, write them down. If you can do the practice exams and worksheets, you should be fine. There are some tricks, but you can prepare for these by doing the practice material.","1224":"This is coming from a guy who knows multiple programming languages and had taken prior programming classes before. Yoon is a nice guy but his exams were very difficult(considering this is would be the first cs course some people take). If this is your first programming class and you have Yoon, be prepared to study thoroughly for the exams.","1225":"he talks too fast he is annoying and he is not beginner friendly","1226":"Fawzi is harder than Nelson. He is a better teacher, but he is slightly harder. I would recommend taking him for 131 over Nelson to build a strong foundation though. If you are doubtful of passing though, take Nelson.","1227":"Nelson is funny, smart, understanding, and super helpful. He is not the traditional college professor in that he really seems to care about each of our success in a deep and person way. He is super nice and gives great advice to be successful in CMSC and life in general. I would recommend this professor to anyone taking any class which he teaches. He is great so I would take him, if you have the chance.","1228":"Nelson is an amazing professor. His lectures are very detailed and he keeps his audience engaged which is super important. He is honestly one of the most understanding professors i've ever seen as he is flexible, helpful, and will always be fair when grading. He is also super funny which helps me stay engaged in the class and genuinely want to go to office hours and every lecture. TAKE HIM if you get the chance, you will not regret it!","1229":"Nelson is extremely student-friendly for a class that can be very challenging for beginners. He records all his lectures which is a life saver for so many. He also gives out plenty of extensions for projects and is very supportive throughout them. He is excellent and, in my opinion, a must-take for any beginner coder like myself. A very engaging, energetic, helpful, detailed, and hard-working professor that I will make sure to take whenever possible.","1230":"Excellent Professor. He explains concepts really well and gives fun interesting projects. If you're regular, the course won't be too hard for you. There are quizzes every week, but I think they keep you on track and make Comp sci easier overall. Would definitely recommend him for CMSC131 especially if you don't have much experience with programming before.","1231":"The professor teaches really well.","1232":"Fawzi is the best natural teacher I've ever seen in my life!  If you go to the lectures you will learn the material.  Period. He's also pretty entertaining and tries to keep things informal and low-key. If you see a few \"mixed reviews\" on sites like this, let me tell you why: Fawzi has a very low tolerance for students who are obnoxious during class. If you act like an ass during the lecture, he will shut you down!  It's pretty funny to watch. So you'll find a few negative reviews from some of those people. But trust me, Fawzi is the best instructor you could possibly get. I'll take him for any course I can.","1233":"This guy is brisk, jovial, relaxed, and accessible. Most lectures are teeming with material, but he somehow makes it all digestible and light. Thing is, some of the topics (like data structures) won't stick to your mind in just one lecture; so you must re-read the slides, draw memory diagrams, and then explain them to yourself until you're comfortable enough.\n\r\nThe projects are appropriate for the subject matter and most of them have their easy or advanced sections already implemented so you can focus only on the stuff you need practice on.\n\r\nQuizzes and exams are all easy as long as you go through the slides and maybe some of the example code. The discussion exercises are seldom helpful, but good for collaboration.\n\r\nI got an A+ and the class is my favorite (most informative) CS class yet.","1234":"He doesn't care about his students.\r\nDon't take his class.\r\nHe knows his stuff, but expects his students to already know the content that he is there to teach about.\r\nWorst professor I've had at Maryland by far\n","1235":"He is a great professor if you're smart. When I mean smart, I mean you know the material well, or pick it up while he's teaching. Everyday he comes to class he is disorganized but is a decent professor. He spends at least five mins per slide complaining about how the slides are wrong or not how he would have done it. The same with the coding examples you see on the CVS. He ASSUMES you remember almost everything from 131 but many friends of mine that tested or AP'ed (not sure how to say it) out of 131 have told me how much 132 sucks because he assumes you know more than you actually do. He is very meticulous with his grading and excessively strict. He is notorious for not curving the class so don't expect it. He curved for our first midterm (we had two) because the average was like a 65% percent. He told us that the exam was going to be easy, however many people didn't finish.\n\r\nHe's not for the average b student because he caters to the smarter crowd. Try to talk to him in person and tell me he isn't an self absorbed asshole. He invites questions but will sometimes ignore simple questions he assumes we should already know. He is rude and even if the TA's agree with you that one of his exam questions are unfair he will debate it to no end until you give up and realize it's impossible to convince him otherwise.\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, he's not a bad professor and I would even recommend taking him as a professor. I just think he's an asshole.\n\r\nRemember, he caters to the smart.He's a decent, but not the best, professor. The only reason I had an 85% was cause I know how to program decently even though I failed one exam. \n\r\nHe's good in the sense that he expects alot from you and in turn you work harder because he doesn't curve. He's tough but not horrible.","1236":"I enjoyed this class a lot from the academic perspective. I have seen him cut students short as is being argued below, but he needs to do so to teach all of the material, and when he does realize he had not heard someone's idea or question through that he should have, he will immediately apologize. He is confident but he does not devalue his student's ideas. In fact he encourages it, and I am confused by comments to the contrary.\n\r\nI may be biased since I had few difficulties understanding the actual material; however, I am new to programming, and did do a lot of work outside the class to keep my grade up and be able to ask suitable questions. Some students asked questions that they should ask during office hours. I have taken advantage of this in the past and he is very thorough at explaining things as long as other students' time is not being completely wasted.","1237":"Fawzi rocks!  The reviews by the angry student below do not represent my views at all. Fawzi's lectures are thorough and clear, his exams are fair, and he has a great sense of humor.  I actually looked forward to going to his lectures! In office hours he isn't going to debug your code for you, but he'll give you enough hints to get you going if you're stuck.  I thought his exam reviews were extremely helpful -- he went over everything that we asked him to in great detail. The exams looked exactly like what he had prepared us for.  He really seems to care about teaching and I'll take any class with him that I can.","1238":"The guy is awful and you are not a great programmer.  Everyone who has not gone to his office, loves him.  Everyone who has seen him personally, thinks he is a world class douche.  I will admit, I am spiteful now because he gave me a D for being less than a point away from a 70 (did bad on the final, was doing well until I took it).  I asked him for something, anything to make up the small difference and not screw me for the next year, but he said it wasn't his problem and that was all.  If you are a natural programmer, take him.  If you need someone who is kind and willing to be nice behind the scenes as well, take ANYONE else.  I have found Golub, Nadua-Perez, Plane,much more approachable.  Fawzi really is a jerk if you are a guy who is a below average programmer.","1239":"Fawzi was a great professor. He explained all the course material in a way that was easy to understand and retain. I took AP Comp Sci in high school and had no problem in this class. Those who dislike Fawzi must have either skipped class often or are not cut out to be Computer Scientists.","1240":"Fawzi Emad is a good professor in the things that he does. However, he is not willing to adapt his style for students who do not learn from his particular style of teaching. He expects you to come to every class, and will tell you what to expect on exams and such only in class (he also teaches using slides).\n\r\n This is not unreasonable; however, for people who learn best by doing and have a hard time following lectures, this can be a problem. On the first midterm, there was a big portion of the grade that was not tested via a project beforehand which can be very problematic for kinesthetic learners.\n\r\nHe also does not offer review problems, or even a sheet listing things to study.\r\nHowever, it should be noted that if you attend class, keep track of the general topics discussed, and take very brief notes, then go back and study slides before the exam, you can do very well. You MUST do these things to succeed, because Fawzi will often test on things that he mentioned once in class that are just historical facts and you won't find in the materials.\n\r\nAlso, pay attention to what appears on quizzes, because it is likely to reappear on exams.\n\r\nBasically, I would say that if you know yourself to be a kinesthetic learner, avoid his class because it will be a struggle to go by his style of teaching, but it is possible to do well with some work outside your normal way of learning.","1241":"Fawzi is an excellent professor.  Explains the material really nicely and keeps the lectures interesting.\n\r\nDefinitely disagree with the idea of him not caring about his students.  He takes time to answer all questions in class and is very thorough in doing so.  The idea of him not caring about his students is quite far from what it seems like in my class at least.","1242":"I also disagree with the person two\/three posts below...  I had Fawzi for both 131 and 132.  I can assure you that he always went out of his way to help us learn the material.  His classes are actually FUN and he is always upbeat and energetic.","1243":"Okay. I had this guy for 131 and 132. He's probably one of the better teachers in the department. He's a decent teacher. Not incredible. He is good at conveying the information, and you will learn the material pretty well. However, there are a few majors problems.\r\nFirst off, I don't think he cares much about his students. He is really into himself, and if you get in his way he will stomp you into the ground. Yes, he will teach you what you need to know, but he makes it fairly obvious that he doesn't care much about the students, but more about the fact that his boss wants him to teach in a certain way. Everything usually needs to go the way that he wants it, otherwise he will get angry.\r\nA big problem with his grading and tests is that he stresses trivial stupid points that don't have much to do with the class. Some of the tests will have not much concepts, but some stupid esoteric stuff about Java that does not really matter.\r\nAnother big problem was that he used lecture slides made by the department that he didn't like. He was always commenting on how the slides were wrong and stupid. Well, if he didn't like them, then he should make his own.\n\r\nHe's a little bit rude as well when it comes to dealing with students, and helps very little with actual exam preparation in the weeks before the final.\r\nOverall, 131 and 132 aren't too bad. The projects take some time, but if you work hard you can get an A. You should probably take this guy over some of the other 131\/2 professors, but you should know what to expect. He just isn't as great as everyone says he is.\n\r\nBy the way, I'm not one of those students who happened to have a bad encounter with Fawzi or anything. I did fine in the class and didn't have any personal issues with him. I'm just telling you what you need to know about this guy.\n","1244":"Nelson is absolutely and unequivocally the worst instructor I have ever had the misfortune of taking a class with. He is decent at lecturing most of the time, but that is not too much of a merit, since he just reads off slides. I have asked questions both in class, and in office hours, and I have never received a satisfactory answer. For example, one time in class, he offered an opportunity for us to ask questions about the current project we were working on. When I asked a question, he told me my question was too complicated to understand, and instead of letting me clarify, he instead told me that he wouldn't answer my question, and would be moving on to the next topic. I decided to go to his office hours to try and clarify my question. However, he would not even let me finish my question before interrupting, and repeatedly telling me my confusion regarding the project was because I had not read the public tests (which is a solution not remotely related to my original question). He was very rude and discourteous the entire time I was in his office.\n\r\nHe uses Piazza (sort of like a forum), under the pretense of having TAs or fellow students being able to help answer questions regarding the class. However, he only uses Piazza as a way to avoid answering nuanced questions himself. This was quite obvious the other times I had attended his office hours, when he would simply tell me to ask my question to the TAs instead.\n\r\nAs noted in other reviews, he stops lecture to call out students unnecessarily for the most ridiculous things. Aside from it not being funny, it is quite embarrassing to be put on the spot like that.\n\r\nHe is able to still be popular among students because he makes frequent jokes all throughout class. While some of them can be funny, a lot of the jokes I find to be annoying. He jokes about marijuana, cocaine, drinking, etc., in order to project a \"chill\" image which the typical college student will find hysterical.\n\r\nTo summarize this review, Nelson has repeatedly proven he is rude, unable to answer questions that are nuanced, and desperate to be liked. Those genuinely are the three most dangerous traits an instructor can have, as he will find opportunities to belittle you throughout the semester if he knows you don't like him. Stay away from his class at all costs.","1245":"People told me Nelson was awesome before I chose his class, but honestly I'm a little disappointed now. He jokes a lot during the lecture, with makes the class seems easy, but I just feel like I cannot really learn from him. Also I don't like him making fun of students in the lecture. \n\r\nI think his exams and quizzes are fair, but the projects are really hard. I personally won't recommend him. In my opinion, he might be a good guy but just an okay professor.","1246":"I took CMSC132 during the summer and I say he's not a bad professor. Lecture material was kind of boring to me as a lot I already knew, but Nelson tried to connect it to real life examples.\n\r\nThe two things I didn't like were that he would make jokes time to time and he would pay too much attention to me. I got 100% on his pop quiz, so I was actually paying attention. I understand why he makes jokes, but I didn't come to class to listen to jokes. I came to learn about OOP. So whenever he did that, I would study something else.","1247":"Nelson is a great teacher. He's very upbeat and likes to tell lots of really geeky jokes during class. He'll know if you're not paying attention and he'll call you out on it, but it's not a big deal. The class is certainly not an easy one. Make sure you have plenty of time to do the projects. Nelson is very accessible and always there to help.","1248":"Funny teacher whose ppt lectures are relatively more interesting. Just do not expect him to help you with any personal programming issues. Easy A. Point questions toward TA. Sometimes does not show up to classes for unknown reasons. Does not do anything he doesn't get paid for, I guess. If you have questions just be sure to ask during class so that he will actually give you an answer.","1249":"Terrible professor. If you have a backround in programming you will be fine. But if you are taking the class because you are forced to take a programming class and are not a CMSC major and do not spead time programming \"just for fun\" you will be lost. And he is not helpful. Most of my conversations with him were as follows; I dont understand this....\r\nWell, we went over that in class.\r\nYes I remember, but I didnt understand it in class either. And I still dont understand it.\r\nWell why dont you understand it? I went over it in class.\r\nI know, but I dont understand it.\r\nOVER AND OVER AND OVER","1250":"He likes to joke around a lot in class and its pretty funny at first but really gets old and annoying after about the first week. When asked a question in class, he'll most likely respond \"come to my office hours\" or \"go to the TA office hours\". Then when you go to his office hours, he gets irritated and tells you that he already went over it in class. He always emphasizes the fact that he cares about his students and wants to see them successful in class. I really question that...\n\r\nBest advice I can give you for this class is to start the homeworks and projects early and do take advantage of the TA office hours. They help out a lot. Also he posts practice quizzes and exams which are pretty good study material for the real thing. \n\r\nOh yea, and never go to his office hours asking about a project that is due soon. I went to ask a question about a project three days prior to the due date about a question the TA's couldn't even answer. He spent 10 minutes lecturing me about how \"successful programmers\" start projects early so that they aren't cramming to do it at the end. Then he told me to go to TA office hours...\n\r\nOverall not a hard class but don't expect too much out of Nelson. ","1251":"the only reason im giving nelson any stars at all is because he explains concepts pretty well during class. other than that, if you have to take 132 this semester, take it with fawzi. nelson wastes A LOT of time saying jokes that have NOTHING to do with class. he may seem funny at first, but when you really need help and he doesn't answer your question, it's not funny anymore. when people ask him questions, he either says \"ask the TA\", \"we already went over that\", or \"come to my office hours\". ive gone to his office hours and he just sends me back to the TAs. he also is not considerate of our time. he gave a project AND homework at the same time (homeworks are like mini projects). i also agree with the person below me about EVERYTHING they mentioned.","1252":"i lot of people liked him. but to me he was very annoying and got on my nerves.  he tries too hard to be funny, and most of the time isn't funny at all.  he also says he does not care if u don't pay attention in class as long as you don't disrupt the class.  but he himself disrupts the class every 5 min to yell\/joke at some kid for not paying attention when the student wasn't even disrupting the class","1253":"Awesome guy. I've had better teachers, but Nelson keeps class interesting with his jokes, and the way he ran his class really helped me to get a solid grip on the material.","1254":"I took him a few years back, he is pretty good at teaching, but goes overboard with the jokes every now and then to a point where you feel kind of embarrassed and annoyed. Some days he is on the money with his comedy show, but some days I really felt like telling him to stfu.\n\r\nThe only other complaint was that he rushed the end of the semester pretty hard, so make sure you stay on top of the material. During the last week he made us memorize details for dozens of design patterns which were all on the final.","1255":"Quite simply, Nelson is among the best professors UMD has to offer. His class is immensely interesting, he is very funny, and he is a fair grader. The work isn't very hard, but if it is, he is very helpful. No complaints.","1256":"I actually took class with Nelson in Fall 2006, but felt that he was such a good teacher he deserved a review now that this site is up. Nelson is an excellent teacher that keeps his students laughing, which keeps the material interesting. Take every class he teaches!","1257":"Nelson is a good teacher. Like everyone has said he tells jokes during class to keep the boring subject material interesting. He also does a good job explaining the projects. I got an A in his class.","1258":"I took 132 with Nelson a few semesters ago, but I did want to mention that he is a great teacher. He keeps class interesting, always cracking jokes and telling stories. My only complaint is that sometimes I was in the mood to just learn what I needed to and leave, and sometimes the jokes were a little too much. Other than that, I learned a lot and had a bit of fun, too. Got an A in his class.","1259":"Nelson is one of the best professors I have had at Maryland.  He always keeps his lectures interesting with jokes and stories.  He also is great at teaching the material so it's easy to understand.  His projects take some time, but he gives a great explanation of exactly what you need to do.  Definitely try to take your CS classes with Nelson (everyone calls him by his first name).","1260":"Larry Herman has his pros and cons, but overall I thought he taught the material well.\n\r\nPROS:\r\n-Very detailed and course oriented. Almost never goes off on tangents.\r\n-Likes to use funny analogies to explain concepts in class, which helped me remember more clearly.\r\n-Projects were fair and were more practical than the ones I did last semester for 131.\r\n-Exams were generally easy, and stuck to the practice problems he posts on ELMS.\r\n-His obsession with koalas is hilarious.\n\r\nCONS:\n\r\n-Tends to be abrasive and mean in class sometimes. God help you if he catches you with your phone more than once.\r\n-Typically doesn't fully answer questions from people in lecture because he claims he needs to rush through material, leaving people even more confused sometimes.\r\n-Not exactly the most approachable  or nicest person around, which might discourage people from going to office hours.\n\r\nYou'll learn in his course, and you'll learn a lot. But Larry isn't the nicest guy around.","1261":"I\u2019ve only taken 2 comp sci classes at Maryland but I definitely learned a lot from Mr. Herman. Starting with the cons:\n\r\nMr. Herman means well but seems to lack skill in social interaction (unless he is disciplining someone). He never seemed to want to look me in the eye when I tried to ask him questions before or after lecture, and talks like a robot at times. He is not the greatest lecturer: he repeats himself often and kept saying that he was \"behind\" for the last 5 weeks or so of the semester. During that time he didn't really ask if there were questions on the new material, but is very responsive if you go to his office hours or ask for help outside of class. Very strict about the \"No laptops or electronics\" policy...he kicks people out of class for texting during lecture. I think he got his count up to 20 between two of his three lecture periods when I was in 132 with him. \n\r\nSwitching gears though, Mr. Herman is very knowledgeable about Java and the computer programming paradigm. His lecture slides are an amazing resource, sometimes better than the textbook (which, for 132, I highly recommend you get, even if you\u2019re a Java expert, as it contains a lot of powerful concepts and goes into detail on some foggy areas beyond the 132 curriculum that are still good to know).\n","1262":"I would like to start off by saying that Herman is not as bad as many people say. I feel that most of the low reviews he gets are from freshmen who are not prepared for the amount of work this class will take. With that being said, I will give you as honest a review of him as I can. Keep in mind that this is my second high level programming class (I'm an EE major so I already saw many of the concepts presented in this class in my 150 class)\n\r\nI'll start off with the bad. Herman can be kind of an asshole at times. He follows his syllabus to the letter, so if he specifies that he  will only answer programming questions in office hours, HE WILL ONLY ANSWER THEM IN OFFICE HOURS. Like even for simple yes or no questions, he will only answer them during office hours which can get really annoying.\n\r\nHis exams are another negative point. For a 100 level programming class, I felt that there were unnecessarily difficult, and this was having already seen most of these concepts in another class already. His exams are often extremely specific, sometimes testing concepts that were only vaguely mentioned during a lecture and are often unnecessary to know for practical programming purposes.\n\r\nWith that being said, Herman is an extremely good teacher. I honestly thought he was a good lecturer, may not have been the most interesting but hey, you try and keep this stuff interesting through 5 different lectures of the same topic. If you want to be successful in this class, go to his lectures as much as possible. I would also recommend using his office hours a lot, not because he will only answer questions during them but also if you ask him a question then you will get a detailed and thorough answer that will almost surely help you. \n\r\nLike I said, I have seen most of the programming concepts presented in this class in a previous coding class, however, I still found his projects to be rather straight forward. If this is your first high level programming class I would suggest starting early, but you should not have difficulty completing them on time and getting a good score on the project.\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend Herman if you really want to learn the topics presented in 132. Yes he is an asshole, but it will be worth putting up with because you will learn a lot.","1263":"People give Larry a hard time, but I don't think he's too bad. I find his expectations reasonable, and I think he does a pretty good job of teaching the material. That said, he's kind of a jerk. His classroom rules are ridiculously strict, and he wastes a solid 5-10 minutes of every class yelling at people for using cellphones in class or telling people who walk in late that they should attend later lectures. He's not a particularly approachable teacher, and even discourages asking questions because he fell behind on the course material. I feel like I'm learning a lot from Larry, but the actual classroom experience is pretty annoying. \n\r\nDespite my objections to the way Larry approaches his teachers, I disagree with the reviews that say that the class is too difficult or that the workload is too much. The projects give me a greater understanding of the material and the tests seemed like a good barometer of my knowledge. Not an easy class but appropriate for the subject matter. ","1264":"At first, I really didn't like him, and I never really got over annoying things that he does such as go over administrative stuff at the start of each lecture and calling out anyone on their cell phone during class.\n\r\nHe's not necessarily the nicest person ever, but he is an extremely smart person and does a good job explaining things.  He posts 3 old exams before each midterm, and the tests are fair and not hard if you prepare for them.\n\r\nIf you regularly attend lecture and did well in 131 you should be fine even if you get 'stuck' with Larry in 132. At the end of the day he's a smart guy and good teacher","1265":"I had a problem with Larry Herman's lectures.  \n\r\n(1) He lectures off slides that are sketchy and incomplete, speeds through them, often flipping before students who write really quickly can jot down notes, and refuses to post slides in advance so that students can prepare for how he speeds through them and take notes on the slides themselves.\n\r\n(2) He uses vague ambiguous, conceptual verbiage that doesn't convey the underlying technical specifics so that you can learn the material in a concrete way from his lecture delivery.  \n\r\nFor example, on joining concurrent threads:  \"A thread can wait for another one to terminate by calling join(). public final void join() returns when the thread it's called on quits\"  There is no specific technical information in that passage that tells you what to do or what is happening in the software.  \n\r\nHere is the kind of specific, technical language that is more helpful, from in the tutorials on docs.oracle.com: \"The join method allows one thread to wait for the completion of another. If t is a Thread object whose thread is currently executing, t.join(); causes the current thread to pause execution until its thread terminates.\"  \n\r\nYet, Herman teaches with fuzzy, untechnical language but tests to a much higher level of technical rifor than he lectures with.\n\r\n(3)  All the students in the class who have language disabilities or communication disorders are completely swamped with trying to make sense out of his terrible lectures off sped-through slides and ambiguous language, and finding alternative instructional materials\/spending days in the tutoring lab inorder to compensate sucks time that is frankly unavailable to CS students.\n\r\n(4)  HIs tests are unreasonable to an absurd degree.  He tests on variable names that are in example code that come as side downloads to his lectures.  His use of variable names in such side code downloads is nonstandard.  The amount of pedantic memorization he requires is excessive.","1266":"Way too much work for a 4 credit 100 level class. Larry seems to forget that some of us are taking other classes. I am seriously not one to complain about work overload as I am usually pretty good at time management but good god this is another level of crazy.","1267":"Herman is possibly one of the worst computer science \"instructors\" at UMD. From day one, I came into the class not expecting much after reading most of the reviews on here and on Course Eval. Larry is one of the rudest people in the entire computer science department and always has a smug look of discontent on his face when he teaches in his monotone voice. His tests border on unfair. He gave our section a test in which the average was 15 points lower than the other sections yet he didn't curve it or even acknowledge it. He takes attendance by forcing students to sign a sheet which in the end did nothing, he punished students for asking questions which were on the \"course information posted on ELMS,\" he talks about rules and guidelines for 20 minutes every class and then complains about not having enough time for questions. Overall, I would NOT recommend Herman and ask that you stay away, as far away from this man as possible if you want to do well in CMSC132.","1268":"Decent professor in terms of communicating the material. Most of the other reviews cover his unique style like the no electronics policy, taking attendance every lecture, and not letting students sit in the back.\n\r\nAt first I hated his style, but later on I realized that the way he teaches drills the material into your head and forces you to pay attention. If you attend most of his lectures and sit in the front and pay attention, I guarantee you'll get an A. His exams were fairly straightforward, but the only thing I didn't like about them were the extremely specific details to which questions were asked. He would change one little obscure thing to see if you really knew your stuff. Annoying, but manageable.\n\r\nOverall, Herman is decent at teaching. Sure, he's not the best or most exciting professor out there, but he gets his job done provided you, the student, do your part.","1269":"There is a reason larry has the worst average gpa for this class. He is a very bad teacher and your best hope is to get a good TA. Dont take him if there is another option. His exams are impossible and the average for the final was a D. He will try to trick you or put long instructions, MAKE SURE YOU READ THEM CAREFULLY. Even if you miss one detail that could make you end up with a C. Avoid this guy at all costs. He is monotone as well. People who say he is good for 216, well he should teach that class then. \n\r\nTo the guy above me. \n\r\nWHATS YOUR POINT?\n\r\n1) All the professors in universities teach as much or more than herman does. There no excuse for him reading off slides the whole lecture and then testing on one concept he went over for 30 seconds. He cant teach period. \n\r\n2) You got a B so you have no right to say his exams arent hard or tricky and people should have done better. Why dont you try taking a good professor who can actually teach like fawzi or nelson and then compare them with herman.\n\r\n3) Again you got a B. Maybe you shouldnt be in CS by your own standards. Try taking a guy who is actually interested in teaching his\/her students like fawzi and nelson.  ","1270":"Here are the points against him, and I'm going to give you reasons why those things are not true, or don't matter. \n\r\n1) He is boring. \n\r\nYeah, YOU try teaching 9 lectures a week and tell me if you can keep all of them interesting. What are you expecting? Entertainment? He's here to teach you and it's your responsibility to learn. \n\r\nHe's nice and is always helpful in office hours. He moves deadlines if the class says they need more time. That more than makes up for class being \"boring.\" \n\r\n2) He tries to \"trick\" you on exams. \n\r\nThey're not tricks if you know what you're doing. Do you think you'll get hired anywhere if you don't know what you're doing? \n\r\n3) He makes you work \"too hard\" for an A. \n\r\nPeople who don't like Larry are either not good at working hard or don't want to. If you don't want to, you probably shouldn't be in CS. \n\r\nHis exams are just difficult enough that you have to study the material and understand it on a deeper level, and that's not a crime. If you want to coast through classes, you probably shouldn't be in CS. ","1271":"The short review is as follows: Larry Herman is good at teaching but terrible at conveying his expectations. You need to understand and memorize EVERYTHING he mentions, even in passing, to excel in the class, and you need to start on programming projects much sooner rather than later because they are deceptive when you first read the description.\n\r\nIn detail:\r\nMr. Herman is the best lecturer I have had in the past five semesters. In addition to knowing the course material, he is typically capable of conveying it to the class. His M.O. is to lecture using PowerPoint slides, asking the class if they understand before he discusses examples. MOST of these slides are posted on Blackboard a few days later, but they often have questions without answers on them. The examples that he presents in class are always basic illustrations of the topic at hand. He also maintains the class's interest when he talks about the more pedantic aspects of OOP by seamlessly working brief, amusing comments into his lectures.\n\r\nOn the other hand, however, I must remark that the class is heavily geared toward audial instruction. That is, the \"learn by doing\" aspect of the class is lacking. I was disappointed that there was little middle ground when it came to the difficulty of assignments. While the worksheets in discussion were similar in difficulty to the lecture examples, projects were significantly time-consuming. Part of this may have been because while I personally learn best by reading the book\/writing code, the text for the class only discusses data structures, and not other  topics covered in the class (Out of five, only the second and third projects focused predominantly on creating data structures. The first was a review of CMSC131, the fourth was about graph traversal, and the fifth was about multithreading, I\/O, and connecting to the Internet).\n\r\nFurthermore, tests were obnoxious, in the sense that perhaps 20% of each test dealt with trivia. In the case of the final, this took the form of, \"Do you happen to remember this fact about Java that I mentioned offhand halfway through the semester, and that you probably never used when you were completing the projects?\" The rest of each test was either writing code or tracing a program. The grading is stringent - I recall losing 8% on the second exam because I implemented (correctly) an O(n^2) algorithm instead of an O(n log(n)) algorithm. Basically, in most cases, it does not suffice in this class to get your program to compile and function correctly; you must also write it efficiently and know other ways you could have achieved the same functionality.\n\r\nAll in all, Mr. Herman has been my second-favorite teacher at UMD (after Prof. James Schafer of the Math department), and a few, but not all, of my complaints about the class are not his fault. I was actually signed up for Mr. Emad's section of 132 at the beginning of the semester, but I switched out immediately after sitting in on one of Mr. Herman's lectures. Best decision so far of my college career.\n\r\nOne final note: as you progress through the class, make a condensed version of your notes to serve as a rudimentary study guide for exams. It will be very helpful.","1272":"Insufferable prick.","1273":"Lectures:\r\nIn most of his classes, he starts out by talking about something in his life (or ends up talking about it), which is fine - if I weren't paying for classes! It takes up time, and sometimes he doesn't go over as much as he wanted. He absolutely hates if someone's using a laptop or phone in class, which is understandable...but he sounds like a douchebag when he asks someone to put it away. He usually goes over his slides by reading them, and not really adding to them. If he does add to them, write it down, cause his quizzes and tests are nitpicky. He rarely writes on the board, and if he does, make sure you're in the front, cause he writes small ! \n\r\nQuizzes:\r\nI don't think he writes his own quizzes. The set up of the worksheets usually have nothing to do with the quizzes. Don't focus on what the worksheets are on, cause most likely, it's not gonna be on the quiz. There were only 2 times where the class knew what the quizzes were on. He doesn't even really give the TAs a heads up on anything, so the TAs are clueless until the day of the quizzes. Also, most of the time, the average on the quizzes are around 20-25 points out of 40, so don't give up...\n\r\nHomework & Projects:\r\nDon't ever ever turn anything in the night it's due. If the server goes down, he may or may not give an extension. Try to get all the points on the Homework, cause that will help your grade. Even though you only need to get HALF of your tests working on the projects, try to get 60-70%, cause his TAs might rule out some of the public tests that you *thought* you passed. Plus, going above the minimum means you'll probably be above the curve. Try to get some secret tests done, too....cause some people don't do those, and that's about 30 points.\n\r\nTA:\r\nTry not to get Gleneesha, cause she'll just point on the board at code and expect you to understand what it does. She doesn't really explain anything, and if she does, it's not thorough. It makes me think she doesn't know anything. Granted, I heard all TAs sucked, especially for CS, but it'd be nice to have someone who DIDN'T have to Google some answers in front of you...\n\r\nBooks:\r\nDon't bother buying them. I bought them halfway through the semester thinking they'll help, but I have yet to actually use them. Half the class didn't buy any, and they're doing fine. He also asked the class (of those who bought them) if they were useful, and everyone said no. Don't bother.","1274":"I'd taken this class before in high school, so I was decently well off. If I hadn't taken the class before, it wouldn't have gone so well. Herman is a very dry teacher, who doesn't teach very well. He knows his stuff, he just doesn't know how to convey it very well. I'd advise against taking him for higher level classes. Book is not neccessary, just look things up on the internet.","1275":"Larry Herman is THE WORST Comp. Sci. teacher I have ever had. Please stay away from him, and avoid him at all costs. He has a very monotone voice and he will put you to sleep no matter what. He is a very cocky professor and expects the worst from students. He would always expect students to answer his questions wrong, but they would say the right answer so then he would reword the question so no one would understand it. He always emphasized that the Honors class did way better than us, but the fact is that they did better because he was not teaching the Honors section. Quizzes averaged around the 50-60% in our class, and it was solely because he does not explain concepts well. If you have no choice but to take the class with him, expect a lot of self-teaching and expect a lot of stress. He assigns projects that are always half-assed and is always revising them up to the last second.\n\r\nHe says \"Umm...um...um...\" a lot, and he makes awkward comments to girls. Overall, he is a very awkward person and he seems to be the only uninteresting Comp. Sci. professor. Quizzes are easy if you learn everything by yourself. Exams are graded in a strict manner so it is really hard to get a decent grade on the exams (1 midterm, and the final).\n\r\nBesides wasting time trying to figure out how the projection boards work, he goes off in tangents. Most of the class stopped attending his lectures, so he started taking attendance. So people went to the lectures just to sign the attendance sheet.\n\r\nHe will call you out if you have your laptop out, if you are sitting in the very back, if you come to class late, or if you leave early. He is extremely annoying and rarely sympathizes with you (except if you are a girl). ","1276":"Herman is a good lecturer. I had taken AP Comp Sci AB and gotten a 5 coming into this class, so I knew a decent amount of the material beforehand. His lectures are generally well done and he knows what he is talking about. He has some weird habits though. Whenever something goes wrong he will always make up like 100 excuses as to why it's not his fault. He's kind of pompous, but class was pretty enjoyable.\n\r\nThe quizzes were pretty easy imo, but the class averages were always terrible (25-30). Look over the past couple lecture slides before the quiz!!! The midterm and final were both very fair.\n\r\nHomework & Projects: Do NOT wait until the night before it's due to start. Seriously, don't. The projects and homework are all doable, but they will take serious effort on your part. You will get stuck, you will have to redesign code, you will have to use the debugger, and you will have to read all the specifications beforehand. That being said, it is possible to do well on all the projects. I got 100% on all the public tests for projects. I can't comment on how the office hours works, I never had to go to them.\n\r\nTA: Gleneesha was a pretty terrible TA imo. I went to most of the discussion sections, but I only learned a couple things from them. The worksheets that they give you in discussion are useless, I would just use the time to study notes and work on projects. \n\r\nBooks: Overpriced and not needed. The internet is the only resource you need. \n\r\nOverall: I thought the class was pretty good. Herman has gotten some pretty awful reviews but I think a lot of them are frustrated students who didn't put enough effort in the class.","1277":"Boring... Pedantic... Out of touch with students... Laurence is a crap CS teacher and avoid him if possible. He turned me off to the field of compsci and after his class I changed my major.","1278":"Larry is easily one of the most boring professors the CS department has to offer. While some professors' tangents can be a nice break and funny...Larry's are not funny. He teaches in a way that, I think, is very hard to understand--and Java is already a very abstract concept. With less examples, and more powerpoint slides, you're almost on your own. If you end up with a crap TA...good luck.","1279":"So larry is NOT a bad guy at all and he is sometimes very funny in class with his jokes during lecture, but beware if you have him prepare for lots and lots of stress.\r\nThe beginning of this course proved to be very easy because before the midterm exam (end of october) all we had were 2 quizzes, 1 homework, and 1 project. Note that the grading system is sooooooo stupid that if you make a mistake that doesnt even make an impact on your work, you WILL lose alot of points. So be careful and read the directions because even if you show that you understand the problem and explain it very well, you will lose full credit if you dont follow the exact directions. That is what happened to me, i lost 2 letter grades on a quiz on something that stupid even though i clearly understood the problem. \n\r\nAfter the midterm he just threw everything at us at once, all the hws, projs, and quizzes giving us barely anytime, he had to give a hw and a prog at the same time over thanksgiving because he had to fit it all before the semester is over! I had no problem with this because i knew the material already but for those who dont know the material, your pretty much screwed. Also office hrs are always packed so go early if you need help.\n\r\nI took ap programming in high school and i understood every single topic in the class but yet i still couldnt get an A+. The reason is because of the grading again. It is just terrible and he is very slow at getting your work back. It is december 17 and only 40% of our grades have been posted. We still havent gotten back our proj 2,3,4 and hw 2,3 back yet which is the majority of our grade. Plus the TAs do not know what they are doing. Most of the time i think im smarter than them. If you want an A or even a B you must know the topic before you take the class, or else you are pretty much screwed.\n\r\nI had to go into office hours many times to correct some stuff they weren't clear on. One of the secret test was written wrong for project one and i had to argue it too and i still dont know if he changed it because he hasnt updated the grades yet.\r\nAll programmers know that when comparing objects you either return a negative or postive number or zero. On the stupid secret test they wrote it so that it checked to see if you did -1,1 and 0. That is wrong and i had to tell Mr. Herman. Plus the submit server doesn't work all the time so turn in your projects early.\n\r\nThe problem with not getting our many projs and hws back is the fact that we cant go in to see Mr. Herman to see what we did wrong cuz the semester is over!! so if i find out that they graded something wrong (which is very likely) contacting and arguing will prove to be so much pain.\n\r\nSo over all this class will be easy yet stressful for those who know the subject and a horrible nightmare for those who dont know it well. So good luck to those taking this class!! You're going to need it haha\n","1280":"While it is obvious that Larry Herman knows his stuff, classes weren't all that interesting and sometimes dragged on. His examples seem almost insulting - I think he would be able to get his points across quicker if he explained concepts using graphs and diagrams rather than drawing reluctant volunteers to the front to do something for him.\n\r\nHe isn't a terrible person, not at all, but I also wish he would answer simple questions (such as small questions about the syllabus) via email. But I think he has the right to ask that project-related questions are asked during office hours, since it takes a while to sit down with someone and debug a program.\n\r\nMy biggest problem with him though is that he started giving the projects late, meaning that we're getting one less project than the syllabus indicated and having back to back projects. \n\r\nAnd he takes forever to put up the lecture slides! I think it'd be better to put the slides up BEFORE the lecture and then editing them after! It would make it much easier for everyone.","1281":"Herman did not make the class enjoyable whatsoever! I slept every single class until I discovered the Diamondback crossword puzzle. He needs to show more enthusiasm and be able to effectively teach the class. Also, he wasted a lot of time pulling teeth for random questions directed at the class. There was only one person in my class who actually was able to keep his eyes awake long enough to pay attention. And that guy just happens to be the biggest computer geek I've ever seen. He literally had the projects done two days after they were released. Everyone else just quietly and miserably failed.","1282":"Nelson is a great professor. He tells jokes to make class interesting. Some may find this distracting however. I took him for 132 and 216. He's a really nice guy.\r\n\r\nThe projects are difficult but they can be rewarding.","1283":"What you would expect from a professor. He goes through the material relatively well, but fails to engage the class in any way. I was fortunate enough to have Nelson post his lectures for the class so I don't go to lectures anymore, but overall I feel the class is still manageable by just reading the power point slides posted online. \r\nCMSC132, in general:\r\nQuizzes can be annoying I recommend taking them seriously because they can really impact your grade if you don't do well.\r\nProjects: Projects were relatively easy I would just give yourself enough time to do them.\r\nMidterms: Overall, were generally fair but have very nitpicky questions in some cases, doing the practice midterms that are posted is more than sufficient study material. ","1284":"First CS professor I've had and seems to be one of my favorite professors so far. CS material can be really confusing but Nelson uses simple analogies to make sure his students understand what's going on. Really engaging as well, both inside and outside the classroom. If you have the chance to take him, do so. ","1285":"Pedram is really good at balancing teaching concepts and explains the actual code that goes into the course. The only caveat I\u2019d say about pedram is his discussion sections aren\u2019t always relevant.","1286":"Easy to follow.","1287":"He was my discussion TA. He not only knew the material, but was able to communicate it well. ","1288":"Very friendly and helpful TA. He prepared his own slides for every discussion and shared it in a Slack channel with the whole section. ","1289":"Not the most entertaining professor and a bit dry but overall learned a lot during the class. The project guidelines are extremely detailed and specific which is very nice. Exams are fair. ","1290":"Now that I'm in 216 I have great appreciation for Raghav who prepared me for the content for this semester. Extremely friendly.","1291":"Although he does yell at students to move up to the front row, cites random studies that have little relevance to the class, and prevents students using their laptops and phones, Herman is overall a really good professor. Believe it or not, he does these annoying things because he cares about making students doing their best. If you genuinely care about learning the material and pay attention during the lectures, you can definitely succeed. His jokes and humor are different, but he does this to make his class as interesting as he can. Before the exams, he always posts ungraded homeworks and practice exams, and for our 3 exams, the review material was similar to the real thing. \r\n\r\nBetween taking Pedram and Herman for CMSC132, I got stuck with Herman due to scheduling and was initially upset, but looking back, I am glad that I was and would take Herman over Pedram if I had to do it again.","1292":"A good professor overall with answers to all your questions and willing to admit if he doesn't know the answer off the top of his head. Entertained every question a student threw at him, even if he had to defer to later in the class to answer it. Many felt his midterms were extremely difficult, but they're fair tests of your knowledge in the class. They're challenging, but they're not impossible if you study all the content and can write the code. For all the exams, Pedram said what the coding section would be on (of course not the specific question but the general topic) to make sure you knew going in. ","1293":"Very mean guy. Would not recommend. I passed his course, but I hated going to lectures.","1294":"No Piazza forum to ask questions only TA hours. When I asked the TA why he doesn't set up a piazza forum, he quoted Pedram and said \"I'm too lazy.\" Average on the midterms were about a ~60%. Pedram has a very monotone voice and as a result is very boring. Projects were alright, start early and you should be straight. Going to TA hours on the day a project is due is like waiting in line at a yeezy shoe release. I wouldn't take him if I were you. ","1295":"Teaches well and wants students to succeed but is an asshole to anyone who doesn't sit in the front. Detailed project notes but difficult tests.","1296":"He knows his stuff but does not know how to test on knowledge. Midterm averages were pretty low, and about 15-20% of the class had to drop the class just because of those. He's definitely a nice guy, but the TAs weren't great, and the lack of TA office hours will leave you scrambling if you need help on a project. ","1297":"Herman is honestly one of the best professors ive had.  I thoroughly enjoyed his class and teaching style. His tests were difficult but very fair. And his projects are so detailed, they can be very easy. His lectures are boring but like what do u expect, its a lecture... But i do learn a lot. I highly recommend just sitting there and listening. I barley took notes in this class just cuz his slides are so detailed, u dont need to. He also recommends to read chapters ahead of time which really helps. The worksheets are all similar to his tests. Its not that hard to pass, u just gotta try","1298":"He is a horrible lecturer. Do not take him unless you are willing to basically learn all the material on your own outside of class. To make matters worse, he has tons of clicker questions to penalize you for not going to his pointless lectures. And he doesn't allow laptops in class for students who actually want to learn while he's \"teaching.\" The one good thing about his classes is that the grading structure is fair, and the class is organized, but he just has no idea how to communicate the material. He doesn't seem to understand that coding in front of the class in a ridiculously small font while providing little explanation as to what he's doing is not the best way to teach computer science. Going from him one semester to an actually competent lecturer like Eastman the next was a night and day difference.","1299":"Often shy at times, Melika was absolutely brilliant. She was slated to teach 351 one semester but she left the University to pursue other careers. She was my TA for 132. She would help me time after time again with my code, and draw pictures and diagrams to help me understand the data structures. She was at her best when I had one on one time with her. She was very receptive to student concerns during her office hours and tried to help as much as she could with the time she had.\r\n\r\nHer lab sections I thought were pretty helpful. If i didn't understand something from lecture, she always cleared it up and made it easier for me to understand. A shame she had to leave the University, because she was very gifted.","1300":"A good TA who always showed up on time. He was understanding of those who asked for help.\r\nOften, the content of discussion lasted about 20 minutes since we were just going through slides quickly. As it was an 8am discussion, the majority of people started to skip, which was unfortunate.","1301":"He's alright. Nothing special. ","1302":"Pedram is an excellent lecturer. Class is super well structured, and he considers when it might be more effective to show you example code, then slides, or the slides and then the example code. In general, though Nelson is the one posting Piazza updates, he is simply there in lecture, teaching like he always does.\r\n\r\nI've heard when he is not co-teaching with someone like Nelson, his exams are very difficult, so take that into consideration. He is also very boring. A good majority of my section stopped showing up to either lecture or discussion because of this.","1303":"He is not a very effective lecturer, as I end up teaching most of the material to myself outside of class. He gets distracted very easily and will look to call anyone out that is talking to their neighbor or on their phone, even if they are not bothering anyone. This ends up being a distraction to the entire class and I find it hard to focus or take him seriously. \r\nHe posts lecture slides that are very helpful and they reflect the content that  will be on the exams. He is a fair teacher but I do not enjoy going to lecture. ","1304":"Anwar is a good choice. You will have to learn some things on your own as he doesn't go through everything fully. The amount of notes he provides for students is AWESOME. His tangents are funny but were less appreciated when we had to speed through topics at the end of the semester.","1305":"Good teacher, exams can be vague. ","1306":"Great, effective lecturer. He can be boring, but I think that can be overlooked when considering how well he can explain the concepts taught. However, I took this class when Nelson was co-teaching. I'm not sure how well he fares on his own","1307":"He is funny and makes lecture interesting, but attendance isn't mandatory and he records lectures. The exams were sometimes difficult but practice exams were released. He responds to student concerns (changed the release tokens from 24 to 12 hours) and is fair.","1308":"Fawzi is a solid lecturer. He explains concepts extremely well and is generally very articulate and well-spoken. \r\nHowever that being said, his quizzes for CMSC132 are unnecessarily difficult and he's often rude and condescending if you approach him at office hours. ","1309":"This review gives 2 stars for his 132. (For his 250, it will be 4 stars.)\r\nI take his 132 after reading reviews of his 131 here, and realize that his 132 is pretty hard. He delivers content a bit fast in class, while the materials he provides on the website are not good enough to study for quizzes and exams. His quiz drives me mad. If you take his 132, you'd better take notes carefully and make sure everything is covered.\r\nOn the other hand, I recommend his 250, it's much easier than his 132, cool and relaxing. \r\nBy the way, he's really strict, just don't miss any assignment. I feel like he's not quite approachable.","1310":"Herman is a straightforward, clear instructor who makes lectures boring, yet comprehensible. He is very picky about coding style and his exams are very short, so it is easy to lose a lot of points. You can still earn a good grade if you do the exam practice and review the worksheets. Overall, he's not as bad as people say he is, but he is annoying.","1311":"I had Fawzi for CMSC131 and CMSC132.\r\n\r\nPros: He is a really good lecturer that keeps students engaged and makes normally hard material easy to understand via great analogies, detailed examples, and in-class demonstrations.\r\n\r\nCons: Beware of pop quizzes. Also, there are instances of him giving difficult projects. Additionally, in his office hours, he tends to be a bit more condescending that what his lecturing style implies.\r\n\r\nOverall, my experience in his class has been a positive one. You will definitely learn a lot from him. However, be prepared to put in a lot of work every day.","1312":"Yes, he's a good lecturer. He was horrible for 132 regardless. Incessant pop quizzes. Rude during office hours. Unfair exams. I've heard only good thing for his 131 class but don't drink the Kool-Aid: Fawzi isn't all that. ","1313":"Larry is a fun and hilarious teacher, and I must recommend taking his class. His projects have very clear expectations and his tests are straightforward (with lots of review material provided). He is also extremely careful about what he says and takes the class very seriously. (He will correct himself in the next class if you let him know about a mistake he made in lecture.)","1314":"132 with him was drastically different from 131. Pop quizzes were really difficult and he was kind of a douchebag in office hours.","1315":"He is unapproachable and can be very rude at times. His grading scheme is very nit-picky, and he is very unforgiving. For example, if you don't write your name on every other page in an exam, you instantly lose 10% of that exam grade. In addition, he never releases how much he's curving, but if you ask him, the curve is based on your attendance to his class (he takes attendance everyday). I would advise staying away.","1316":"I had Fawzi for both CMSC 131 and 132. I felt that his class for 131 was far better planned and overall the projects and exams were fair. However, for 132 his quizzes were a disaster, his teaching got more confusing, and whenever students approached him in office hours he was extremely rude. Honestly the most overhyped CS professor at UMD ","1317":"Anwar is a great lecturer for 132. He also explains concepts very well. His lectures slides are great too. He doesn't put anything on the exams that he doesn't cover in lecture. Exams are also pretty easy. I usually finish with 20 minutes left and use the rest of the time to check my answers. I also dislike the MC section, which make up a fair portion of the exams, because they're just memorization and can be kind of tricky. Projects are hard to implement, but the project tests aren't hard to pass. I think I got a 100 on most of my projects. When I took it, projects were 40% of the grade, which should make the class an easy A. ","1318":"Herman is an okay lecturer. The main things he has going for him are that his exams are fair, and the graded worksheets are basically free real estate. The lecture slides skim important information, and his lectures are styled so that he asks questions, and the half-dead students give inaccurate answers three, four times, and he needs to clarify the whole concept again. It's inefficient. Just do CMSC132 under Nelson or Fawzi. ","1319":"Larry is highkey boring and unapproachable. For 80% of lectures I attended, I would fall asleep. He doesn't allow cell phones or laptops in class and will call you out every single time he sees it and then complains about how he has to rush through material. It probably adds up to like 10 mins of lecture in addition the times he tells people to not sit in the back rows like every 5 minutes. Also he doesn't record lectures which sucks because I learn better when I rewatch lectures and his posted powerpoints can be vague. I'm currently taking him for 216 and i still hate it lmao.","1320":"Nelson is a really good professor who explains things very well and gives you the resources you need to do well in the class (lecture videos, old exams, discussion questions). His lectures are also entertaining which is something that I miss now that I no longer have him. ","1321":"best discussion TA teacher of all time. would recommend to everyone!! kind and extremely helpful!","1322":"shyam is the best TA i've ever had at this university. he's a blessing to the education system. i don't know how i would've passed CMSC132 without his dedicated support. thanks shyam!","1323":"Go to class, do the midterm reviews and discussion worksheets to study for exams and you should be fine. Also, start early on projects so you can get an idea of what is asked of you before the stress of a deadline.","1324":"His lectures are fine, he sticks closely to the slides and may elaborate with examples. If you understand the slides there's no need to go to class. Pedram is great, super understanding and accommodating whenever I spoke to him. ","1325":"Amazing professor! Had him freshmen year fall seamster and it was a great way to begin at UMD. He cares about his students and gives them every possible tool needed to succeed. His lectures are super fun and entertaining, and projects and exams are all definitely fair. ","1326":"This class was very hard but I feel like Nelson made it bearable. He's very funny and keeps you engaged in the material. I didn't really study for the first half of the class so I didn't do so well early on but later on I payed more attention to his lectures and was able to do much better.","1327":"Fawzi is a good lecturer. I will give him credit in that he is able to present the material clearly and in a way you will understand. However, as a human being, he is very rude. He constantly is making comments to make himself sound so much better than you. He is rude in office hours about your concerns. I felt as though he did not take the time to feel the concerns or engage with the students. There were plenty of comments he made in class that left me feeling offended or upset. That being said, if you do not care about personality, he teaches well. If you want to have a good relationship with a professor, or are the kind of person who needs office hours with a professor, don't take his class.","1328":"Great guy","1329":"Although some of his rules may be annoying (no electronics, sitting in the front row always), he is a good lecturer. You just need to pay attention in class, write down the things he repeats, and *thoroughly* study for the exam. I would definitely recommend him as a teacher.","1330":"Fawzi is a pretty solid lecturer for beginners and his exams are pretty fair. He is open to explaining any conceptual problems you have about what he's teaching (as long as you're willing to wait in the long line for him). \r\nHowever, his quizzes and some of his later projects can be much more difficult than how he formatted them in CMSC131. Specifically for the quizzes, some of them seemed straight up unfair (considering the resources his class provided and the content we had covered). \r\n\r\nI would say that his CMSC132 class is doable, but be prepared for the spike in difficulty transitioning from his CMSC131 class.","1331":"Fawzi is the best! He knows the material inside and out. If you watch his lectures, you'll understand everything. He's really good at explaining even the most difficult concepts. He's also a fun person with a great sense of humor that he uses to make the class even more enjoyable. I get the feeling he has a low tolerance for \"whiners\", which might explain some of the lower ratings.  Lol","1332":"I had Fawzi for both 131 and 132. He's definitely the professor you want for either of these, if you really want to learn the material. His lectures are easy to follow and he makes the class interesting and fun. He's also very friendly outside of class. I went to his office about 6 times and he was always welcoming and helpful.","1333":"Had him for 132 in Spring 2020 and I couldn't recommend him more. Some other reviews say he's rude but I never got that vibe from him. In fact, he's one of the kindest and most humble professors I've had. He genuinely cares about his students. If you have to choose a prof to take online, I'd recommend Fawzi. He handled the transition to online learning very well.","1334":"He's pretty monotone when he talks, but he explains things well, and his projects are okay. The quizzes are brutal though.","1335":"Took this course in the summer and Anwar was a great professor for it. Made class very fun, and made it easy to understand. Plan on taking his 330 class","1336":"Clear and thorough lecturer. Modified the class (exams\/quizzes) to fit online learning well. Nothing really to complain about. (Some people dislike his monotone lecturing style but I think it sounds fine at 2x speed)\r\n\r\nThe TAs really do most of the office hours, grading, synchronous teaching, but that's not a problem because CS TAs are mostly pretty cool.","1337":"Very helpful, engaging, responsive, and dedicated TA. Held review sessions before every exam too.","1338":"Great lecturer, gave reasonable workload and challenging but rewarding and thought-provoking tests and projects.  Only small thing is that he didn't exactly go out of his way to show himself on camera or talk to students directly, but overall I can't blame him during a pandemic.  Never felt like his work was busy work and always gave us access to the slides and notes we needed.","1339":"Lecturing skills were overall okay. The format, however, was just going over what's next in the course until 50m is up. It felt a bit unorganized and the class felt dry as a whole.","1340":"Pedram's lectures are super boring and monotone, but he is a good professor who explains his concepts very clearly. Watching his lectures on a faster speed is essential. CMSC132 was organized super well online (lectures, slides, and code examples always uploaded), although discussions often felt like a mixed bag because we would often just go over random Java topics that we weren't tested on. Around halfway through the semester, the difficulty of the projects and quizzes\/tests (especially quizzes\/tests) did spike a lot. You did have 8 hours for every quizz\/test, though which was very generous. The first half of the course is pretty laidback 131 review.","1341":"Extremely difficult exams. ","1342":"I took this course in Fall 2019\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n+ Competent and informative lecturer. A lot of people say he's boring, but I honestly disagree, he makes extensive use of example code to ensure students understand what's going on.\r\n+ Projects are good applications of what you are learning.\r\n+ Tests are fair.","1343":"Had him for online semester. The lectures were pretty slow but he definitely knew what he was talking about. The exams were a bit tougher than usual but I do feel that they were fair. ","1344":"Nelson is a kind professor who will help you navigate your programming career and learning how to learn. He is decent at teaching and makes the class enjoyable. Do not be fooled by his jokes, if this is the first time that you are learning JAVA, be prepared to work hard in this class, the kids who took JAVA is high school will make it harder for you to get a good grade. I would take Nelson over Yoon for sure. Overall, if you can't get Fawzi(hard exams) then you will be ok with Nelson (he is big on giving your old exams and other resources).","1345":"His exams are extremely difficult and take nearly 8 hours to complete. Although he may brush over exam concepts in lecture, he doesn\u2019t provide any examples of how to actually use the concepts. If you do not have programming experience before college, good luck. ","1346":"Exams were extremely hard, had to spend almost the entire day on them. He was a fine lecturer considering the asynchronous nature of the class.  ","1347":"He sounds like Ben Shapiro if you put his lectures on 1.5x speed but he is very hands off with the online format. You will pretty much only talk to the TAs and there is no live interaction at all with Pedram. His exams weren't that hard imo, but the projects were difficult not because they were hard to implement but because it was difficult to understand what needed to be implemented from the instructions. I've had bettter CS teachers and I've had worse. Decent.","1348":"Great TA, actually amazing, I needed help and he sat with me for like an hour and helped me out. His concepts are very clear and he knows his stuff. ABSOLUTE GOAT!!!","1349":"Amazing TA, he's actually really good and one of the best TAs for CMSC132. If you know him and can take CMSC132 while he's TAing, definitely take this class. 10\/10!!!","1350":"Online lectures are asynchronous and are informative and well structured with lots of examples. Weekly Wednesday quizzes can be challenging but most of the time was on recent material. Exams and quizzes are both timed, however, the time given is reasonable and the content of the assessments is also reasonable. Also had Fawzi for CMSC131 last semester (Fall 2020 - Online) and enjoyed him thoroughly. ","1351":"Prof. Fawzi is super reasonable and super knowledgeable. I would choose him over Nelson again (although I hear Nelson is great too). I loved the projects and the lectures were always informative and easy to understand. The quizzes are challenging but not unreasonable.","1352":"Took this class Fall 2020. Pedram is a good lecturer. He might be a little boring, but he runs through plenty of examples and is very clear. The online exams are very fair, not very difficult but a little time-consuming. Start on them early and you can definitely finish in the allotted time. ","1353":"This is an inherently hard class but Nelson tries his best to make sure everyone is on pace. Office hours are a big help for for this class. The projects are challenging but if you've learned Java before it shouldn't be a big problem. Nelson's lectures\/slides are very helpful and he usually does not test on contents he didn't teach. He also really cares about his students' mental health.","1354":"Pedram's lectures are slow but he explains things really well. His exams are super challenging though, and they cost me big time.\r\nI wish I had some prior knowledge of data structures before I took this class with Pedram because I quickly got overwhelmed by so much new material.\r\nIf you have some previous knowledge though, I don't think the class will be too bad for you.","1355":"This semester was definitely an improvement from last semester when I took 131 with him. Fawzi kept up with the informative lectures and related coding examples, providing helpful study questions, and assigning projects and discussion assignments relevant to the course material. The quizzes and exams were much better time-wise this semester, hence me actually doing better this semester since I get stressed under a ton of pressure. Lectures were almost always out ahead of time, so we had plenty of time to watch them, and quizzes and exams always tested material that was on the lectures. I definitely recommend taking the class with him if possible!","1356":"All in all an amazing instructor. He is funny, engaging, and gives easy exams and quizzes. I learned a lot from this CMSC132 class when I took him back in Fall 2019. Excellent choice to take. ","1357":"I think Herman is good. He seems to care and some of his jokes can be funny. I am very thankful that he records our lectures because he goes kind of fast in class and he gets mad if you take notes on the lecture instead of listening to everything he says.\r\n\r\nI would've preferred taking Pedram for 132 as I had him for 131 and I think he is more of an actual person. He is a nice guy and helped me a lot throughout last semester. Herman just kind of feels like a hermit crab to me. Hes a good teacher but I dont think hes anything special.","1358":"I am a Larry enjoyer. While his lectures can sometimes be a little dry, his jokes are funny and the content is always delivered well. I found that studying from the discussion worksheets and lecture notes was the way to go, since the exams resemble the  homework very closely. A lot of material gets covered quickly, so make sure to stay on top of it. ","1359":"I attended 3 lectures with friend he seems like cool dude. Kinda boring though. xoxo Sheena Sheep.\r\n","1360":"Let me begin this review by saying that Herman's teaching style is a bit of an acquired taste. If you don't think you can acquire the \"taste,\" then you will likely not agree with the rest of this review.\r\n\r\nThat said, although at times I did feel myself starting to fall asleep in class, Herman generally made lectures un-boring enough to thoroughly absorb the content. Lectures even sometimes included interesting off-color dry humor, such as casually referring to \"the almighty above\" whilst describing algorithm complexity. Herman's exams were generally fair, you just have to read (a fact that my expected A- shows that I can't always do). Projects were equally fair, as long as you are not scared away by an 8-page password-protected PDF as your assignment description.\r\n\r\nThe complaints about grading turn-around time aren't unfounded, but it isn't as bad as some horror stories that I have heard from other instructors\/professors. I am still giving Herman 5 stars because this really isn't his fault, it's the TA system's fault.\r\n\r\nFinally, I just want to say if you can bare some quirkiness in an instructor (Herman isn't a professor, he will make this abundantly clear) and possibly one too many sheep references, take Herman.","1361":"Took 131 with him (with zero coding experience) which was brutal, figured the online nature of it made it harder and gave him another short in person. It was pretty much just as brutal, his exams and quizzes are horribly written and super unclear. He gives practice exams but they are absolutely nothing like what the actual exam will be like. If you haven\u2019t coded in highschool don\u2019t even bother.","1362":"Mr. Herman is a really good professor. He knows what he's talking about and he explains complicated topics extremely well during lecture, in such a way that I don't even feel the need to ask questions. He gave us so much practice with the discussion worksheets and exam prep, and it made taking the actual exam not too hard because the style was very similar. You learn the fundamentals of CS in this course and Herman is a great professor to get that knowledge from. ","1363":"I think Mr. Herman is a very good instructor (though he makes it very clear that he is NOT a professor; he once gave us a mini quiz at the beginning of a lecture about this)! \r\n\r\nNow, I should mention that I did have some programming background prior to the course, so I cannot say for sure what your learning experience will be like if you are new to programming besides taking CMSC131. However, I really enjoyed his teaching style. He gives plenty of examples of concepts, and he puts a significant amount of effort into making comprehensive practice exams and homework assignments so that you are well prepared for the midterms. You can also download his slides and (some) code examples after class to further examine them. \r\n\r\nHe does not allow electronic devices in class, and if he catches you using one, he will not hesitate to call you out. I thought that was annoying at first, but his philosophy is that you should be actively listening to his commentary rather than writing everything down on the slides. In fact, when he sees people writing slide material in their notebooks, he won't stop them but he will interject with something like \"you don't have to write this stuff down because the slides will be on ELMS later.\" I think that his philosophy worked well for me, but your mileage may vary of course. He is also very knowledgeable about Java and the Object-Oriented paradigm and will write notes to himself to correct unclear information in his slides or to investigate the answer to a question he was asked.\r\n\r\nThe homework comes in the form of coding projects. His project descriptions are very well defined (albeit lengthy) and help reinforce the material covered in lectures. However, they are graded pretty slowly (the last four projects have not been graded yet as I write this review), but maybe that will change in the future. \r\n\r\nHe also makes a good attempt to engage with his students. He frequently asks questions throughout the lecture to his students and corrects them if necessary. As a bonus, I think he genuinely wants to entertain us and be friendly. For one, he always suggested saying your name when you answered a question. During the last half of the semester, he raffled chocolate and other candy using a specialized program he made. And lastly, you can count on him to try to crack a few jokes every lecture (and even in his assignments too). Yes, they are definitely \"dad jokes,\"  but nonetheless they still made me chuckle and I appreciated it.\r\n\r\nOh yeah and the sheep thing. He likes sheep. But apparently his favorite animal changes from semester to semester, so look forward to that I guess.","1364":"Larry is a fairly good instructor (not professor). His lectures can be a little dry at times (somewhat unavoidable in an intro course), but he is very good at teaching you what you need to know. His project descriptions are remarkably thorough, making it fairly easy to do well on them (provided you put in the work). His exams can be a little tricky, but provided you study you ought to do well. ","1365":"Great instructor. Explains difficult concepts well and learned a lot of material this semester. Made computer science interesting and I look forward to taking 216 with him next semester. Also, great project descriptions. Overall, Herman is incredible and I encourage you to take him.","1366":"Great guy, but I'll be the first to admit that his lectures are dry and his voice is very monotone. I think the difficulty and projects are fair. The TAs he has more than make up for any gaps due to Pedram, honestly the best TAs out of any class I've taken. Quizzes and tests were fair, I don't know what these people are talking about when they said the practice was nothing like the actual exam (obviously he has to change it up from the practice somehow). Only time where this was especially evident was studying for the final since there was legitimately no resources to help practice, but it's due to the CS department not Pedram specifically I believe. Overall, not the worst option, but for sure not the best for 132.","1367":"Fawzi is one of the best lecturers at this university. He's very clear with describing topics, and goes through a lot of examples in class (which are posted) to help you understand the topics. I would strongly advise against skipping lecture since his slides are very basic, so you want to make sure that you are taking good notes. You do have weekly quizzes in discussion, but if you take notes and make sure that you understand the material, you should be fine. His exams are pretty straight forward, but he doesn't have practice exams for you to study from. He does however model his exams off of the quizzes and weekly study questions that he posts, so I would say they are pretty manageable (no trick questions). Office hours are also pretty helpful (usually run from 9-5 every weekday) for clarifying topics. Some of the projects can be a little tricky, but if you start early and go to office hours you'll be completely fine. I think he has a slight curve (couple of points) based on the class averages. I had him for both 131 and 132, and would definitely recommend taking him if you want a solid understanding of intro CS concepts and data structures!","1368":"He's ok, but I wouldn't recommend if you had other options tbh. \r\n\r\nHis lectures are dull and I fell asleep a third of the time. He tries to be engaging during lecture by telling jokes and asking questions (which I appreciate), so I honestly think its his voice\/how he speaks that makes me sleepy. Another thing about lecture is that he doesn't allow use of technology and will call you out if he sees you using your phone or if its on your desk. You should def still try to pay attention during lecture, especially when he's writing on paper. \r\n\r\nHis project descriptions are great though. Make sure to closely read and (I recommend) take notes on project restrictions, edge cases mentioned in method descriptions, etc., especially considering how I've been told incorrect information multiple times by his TAs this semester (don't think this is a Larry issue tho). \r\n\r\nIf you have to take him, I highly recommend doing all the worksheets, practice exams, and HOMEWORKS (they're optional but you will likely see questions similar to or on the material covered in them). His exams are very Larry-y, but once you get used to his exam question style, you can do well. Overall, his class is doable, but you really need to study and get familiar with his tests\/worksheets if you want to succeed. ","1369":"Pedram was a good person to take CMSC132 with. He and the TAs worked hard to make the class a good experience, and it showed. There were a lot of projects, sure, but Pedram's lectures and positive attitude made the class more enjoyable. A little boring during some of the lectures, but still good.","1370":"Larry can be boring but he's very great at explaining difficult concepts very clearly. He goes slow which gives you time to understand the material really well. He also gives a lot of practice for exams. and he uploads all of his presentation pdfs. His project descriptions are very detailed and cover pretty much every edge case you have to consider. He can be a bit strict about the rules but as long as you wear your mask and don't use electronics, you're fine. I would highly recommend him.","1371":"(And CMSC216.) He talks fast but he goes at a slow\/followable pace given how much material he has to cover each lecture. He's one of the most organized professors I've had. His project descriptions are notoriously long, but they detail the entire project so I wouldn't complain much. His practice exams are very good practice for the actual exams. He's a bit strict on rules like masks and no electronics but honestly we all need a professor to put their foot down for the students that are distracting to the rest of the class.","1372":"Had him Fall 2020.\r\nAs other reviews state, his lectures are incredibly dry, but informative. He drones on even at 2x speed. The class is structured well. Projects, exams, and grading are all pretty fair. The third exam was absolutely brutal though. Still, if you keep up with everything (and practice advanced recursion) you'll be fine. Didn't interact with students much if at all, I'm still not even sure what he looks like.\r\nA remarkably average, bland professor.","1373":"I'm really happy to take Fawzi again for CMSC132 (it was a close call because there was only one available spot left for me, probably someone dropped out), mostly because I like his teaching styles and his TAs. \r\n\r\n3 tips to get good grades in his class:\r\n1. Don't skip the lectures! Fawzi doesn't record his lectures\r\n2. Start projects early! You don't want to come to TA office hours 2-3 days before the due date\r\n3. Review weekly! There are weekly quizzes (don't get discouraged because you get low grades, it's a good review for midterms and final)\r\n\r\nThe only thing that is challenging in his course is that you have to study everything for his tests (no idea what he will put on specifically - you know what lectures he will cover, but the contents are massive). It's fair but difficult, sometimes.","1374":"He is ... ok! That is the best thing I can say in terms of lecturing. He is a very nice man, incredibly receptive to any questions and very flexible with extensions regarding religious holidays. He is a bit monotone but thats honestly fine. His TAs were good - when they actually showed up to office hours or discussion sections. The projects were fine with the exception of a few and the DS\/A part of the course was a nice introduction to it. I recommend if you already have familiarity with programming and data structures, Fawzi would be better teaching you from the ground up if you wanted something more comprehensive. ","1375":"I like Nelson a lot, I had him for 131, just took him for 132, and am planning on taking 216 with him. \r\nYes he can get carried away sometimes with messing around, but he teaches you absolutely everything that you need to know for projects\/quizzes\/exams.\r\nEveryone I've ever met who doesn't like Nelson has just been lazy and didn't care to understand what he was saying.\r\nGreat fun guy.","1376":"Nelson is a super funny guy, and he really cares about preparing his students for the future. Very helpful in office hours. In addition to teaching material very efficiently and being very responsive to feedback, Nelson will teach you to advocate for yourself, a skill that is useful for the rest of your life. He is very specific about how to prepare for exams and projects and provides many resources. Amazing professor.","1377":"If you ever have the opportunity to take him for 132, seize it. Fawzi is funny, knowledgeable, and honest. If you want to do well in his class, I would recommend:\r\n\r\n1) Starting Projects Early! Looking at the description is a good start, but I would suggest trying to code as much as you can, submitting, and reviewing the results from the submit server. If you are confused, try to debug the code yourself before seeing a TA.\r\n2) Attending Lectures! Fawzi's lectures are usually entertaining, but he knows when the content is boring and when students like to skip. Sometimes he will give you the topics for the quizzes and coding tricks. \r\n3) Attending Discussions! Discussions usually focus on coding and other technical things which are tested or used in a project. It's in your best interest to show up, do the lab, and ask for help. If you finish the lab, you can usually ask your TA questions about the class or the project.","1378":"Fawzi is by far the best professor I've ever had (I'm only a freshman btw). His lectures are extremely informative and easy to follow, so DON'T MISS A SINGLE ONE! (He doesn't record them) Fawzi's exams and quizzes are extremely fair, and his projects weren't lifeless. I had Nelson for 131 and he was also a good option that had his pros, but Fawzi's projects are more satisfying when completed. Fawzi's projects often have GUIs that make you feel a sense of accomplishment after completing them. If I could, I would take every CS class with him. Yea he doesn't allow you to have laptops out, but you really don't need them in the first place to be able to follow through. Take his class and you won't regret it unless you never go to office hours or you start your projects late. ","1379":"This might be an unpopular opinion because everyone seems to love Fawzi at UMD, but he's just not my type of lecturer. He goes through topics super fast during class and his speed of talking is just a little too fast for me to comprehend. Can't doubt that he genuinely loves what he does and is always really enthusiastic about class though.\r\n\r\nMy least favorite fact about him is that he never records lectures. Sometimes if you're lucky he'll record them on religious holidays but other than that if you ever miss a class you're screwed. I had to miss class for a lot of personal reasons and it really brought me behind and I struggled to bring my grade back up. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, we only had 2 exams throughout the whole course. We literally learned about every type of data structure within one unit and were tested on it all at once. This is simply just too much information for one exam while most other 132 lecturers had at least 3 or four exams. Splitting it up would've not only helped my grade but would have allowed me to focus more on specific topics for specific exams. I just always felt super overwhelmed around exam time because they were pretty much making or breaking your grade. \r\n\r\nAlso it's a good idea to remember that he's not as lenient as Nelson. He doesn't allow computers or phones during class and he usually won't do any extensions unless you have a really good reason. His exams seem to be more difficult than Nelson's but a lot of people are okay with that since they like his style of teaching. This is all just me speaking from personal preference though.","1380":"The nicest, most understanding teacher. His classes are entertaining and he really makes an effort to get to know his students (even in a huge lecture). He presents the information clearly and the tests are very fair. The projects take time but he preps his TAs really well to help. Not an easy class, AT ALL, but Nelson goes above and beyond for his students. Also has very good slides and all classes are recorded (he posts the slides before class and the recordings the second class ends). ","1381":"Fawzi is an incredible lecturer who cares about his students learning and understanding the material. He's been teaching 132 for a while, so his materials for the course - including lectures, labs, and projects - are incredibly polished. It is also evident that he frequently practices giving his lectures in order to stay on top of his game. The material felt well-paced and, even though there were only two midterms, the testable material felt fair and it was not hard to succeed if you took good notes in lecture and sought extra help when needed.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, make sure to take good notes in lecture! Fawzi does not allow the use of laptops for taking notes, and he does not record his lectures. You will need to be on top of your game and write things down in a way that really helps you to understand the content because the lecture outlines he posts online are really not so helpful. Also, start projects early. They are a joy to complete, and procrastinating will really hurt you with some of the projects in this course.\r\n\r\nIf you have the option to take Fawzi for 132, do it. He is a top-notch professor and a cut above the rest of the instructors for this course.","1382":"Unpopular opinion but without bluff like some of these other reviews. (NOTE: I had Nelson first semester and received a very good grade so 132 with Fawzi was a shock. I have completed the course but chose to leave it optional out of confidentiality).\r\n\r\nFawzi is too fast paced in lecture. On top of that his powerpoint are next to useless and he doesn't record lectures. On top of that he doesn't give fair exams in my opinion. I will admit the midterms were fair, but they test the smallest details which you wouldn't need in the real world or which a compiler would pick up. For example, on one of the exams I declared a variable incorrectly, with the rest of my code is logically and syntax correct I only received 2\/14 points. I approach external TA's who said I should receive points, but when I approached Fawzi on the regrade he refused to give points back and gave an excuse as to why. In additions we only had 2 exams unlike other classes, where they would split we had all of OO(Object oriented programming) and the entire second exam on every DS (data structure). \r\n\r\nOutside of the course work to sum up Fawzi in a few words:\r\n- shrewd\/out right disrespectful \r\n    - Doesn't help in office hours. Always acts like he's better and we know nothing.\r\n- not lenient at all\r\n     - Was sick and couldn't make it for a quiz. Fawzi told me either to come for the quiz or receive a 0 (this was the second time I was sick and couldn't use a self attested note). Especially for a time while we are still in a pandemic this was out right disrespectful and foolish that he is willing to risk the health of his TA's and students for a quiz.  \r\n- doesn't care about his students mental or physical health\r\n   - Over this semester I was struggling with my mental health a bit and when I approached Fawzi about his essential response was I don't care. He is not as nice and caring as nelson, I didn't receive any help throughout the course during this. Outside of that office hours were always packed and the TA's were quite bad. \r\n- comes off as some high achieving professor with lots of publications and no time for his students when in reality he's a lecture (massive ego problem)\r\n\r\nOutside of this his class is taught like we are all high end comp sci people who know what we're doing. His exams once again are more difficult than nelsons. If you could I would avoid Fawzi at all cost and take Nelson. Nelson was one of the best professors I've had across all departments. \r\n\r\nOther Notes (sorry if repetitive to some other parts of the review):\r\n- Doesn't give practice exams\r\n- Doesn't tell us a concept list like Nelson or any other teachers\r\n- Refuses to record lecture \r\n- Steep late penalty (20% off your highest score if submitted at or after 11pm. 100% off after submitting 24hrs after the deadline).\r\n- 1 practice packet with questions that don't resemble exams a week\r\n- Quizzes were very hard for weekly assignments (we also didn't know the context)\r\n- Purposely goes into harder concepts which aren't relevant material to the course (refers to 351 and theoretical CS concepts we don't learn a lot). \r\n- Final Exam is the worst. 30% of the grade. Everything we wouldn't have been tested on for an FRQ was there. You cannot expect first time students with no experience to come in and redo parts of their project by hand. You cannot make students code out concepts you referred to for 5minutes in a lecture. You cannot make students code a question we have never seen a code example for and something which was barely touched in class. A final is cumulative that includes everything we were taught not everything after the midterms and the concepts we barely went over. \r\n- Labs also aren't too helpful and I think he should adjust the labs to have a due date of completion so students actually do then and cut down on the weight of the final exam. a final worth 30% dropped by grade from B to (well you can do the math for that :)). \r\n- Projects in others classes are worth way more overall than ours. \r\n\r\nFinal thoughts: I wish I took nelson when I had the opportunity to while registering. If I could go back into that time and choose nelson I would've probably got a B+ at the lowest. Nelson's exams side by side Fawzi's are much easier on relevant materials and won't make or break your grade such as Fawzi. Unlike the other reviews I can't say that he enjoys teaching. From what I experienced he enjoys the idea of being the smartest in the room at what he does which isn't a trait for a good teacher.","1383":"Fawzi had a lot of positives that really made the semester quite good! His lectures are very informative and he's very good at what he does. After I left a lecture, I really felt like I knew what I was doing. I completely understood each thing he taught. The review before mine wraps up my thoughts completely, but I will reiterate them.\r\n\r\nFawzi, like was stated, is a VERY good professor which will make sure you understand his concepts. I had Nelson for 131 and switched to Fawzi for 132. Altogether, I highly prefer Fawzi. Lecturing is better, exams better reflect what we've learned, labs are useful, and the quizzes were fair. All in all, so long as you studied you should be fine. \r\n\r\nAs for criticism, I am not a big fan that he didn't record lectures. It makes it hard to catch up or do well if you have any need to miss class. I also had been a bit upset initially when he said no computers in class, but those who wanted to takes notes on it ended up ignoring it and taking notes anyways. He does try to hold people at the end of class and gets upset if you leave early. There was only 2 exams which were weighted heavily which also covered an extremely large amount of information.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I would absolutely recommend taking Fawzi if you want a strong foundation in CS fundamentals and data structures as a whole. However, it may be best to not take him if you are to not keen on going to every class or if you think that you aren't going to really put in the time to study for every exam.","1384":"Fawzi continues to be an excellent CS prof as he maintained his sense of humor and teaching style that he had in 131. Any tips are obvious things you should already be doing (going to class, starting projects early, etc). The only problem I had with his class was that there were only 2 midterms, the second of which had an enormous amount of information that was covered. The projects can be challenging, but most of the TAs are great resources for help on class or project material. The final was fairly daunting and could've been designed better, but nevertheless, I would absolutely take Fawzi again if I could. ","1385":"I really enjoyed having Pedram for 132 this semester. Lectures were really helpful and material was interesting. Projects weren't too difficult when started early, and quizzes felt honestly somewhat easy. However, I will note that this semester he co-taught 132 with Nelson, so I can't speak to his class when it's not cotaught. Very nice and approachable as well, would definitely recommend.","1386":"I understand why he's rated the lowest compared to all the other professors, but he isn't too bad. If he's the only one available, you should be fine.","1387":"This class was alright. Nelson's projects are not well-written in my opinion, and it's hard to understand what is actually wanted us to do. Sometimes, it's also hard to understand where to begin the projects, but that's different for everyone of course. Nelson made the exams pretty easy though, especially the final exam. He's also responsive through Piazza and understood if we needed deadlines pushed back for projects, so I most definitely appreciated that. Discussions are alright, but they are definitely not necessary to attend. ","1388":"Genuinely a wonderful person. You can tell that he really cares about his students and wants everyone to succeed. The course itself was pretty easy, although Nelson didn't go too in depth into the particulars of most topics, just focused on an overview and how to do things without too many details. That's not my favorite way of learning information (jumping right into looking at code), but the exams and projects were fairly straightforward. I always felt like I knew what to do and like I could get help whenever I needed it. He records every class, which makes it easy to do well even if you can't make it to every lecture or discussion.","1389":"He's a decent lecturer, but still confused as to why he is so overrated. I definitely do not think his lectures are boring, I did get sleepy a lot of the times but that's probably because I had 8AM classes and was always extremely tired. He makes jokes and I think he tries to be an engaging professor. I will however say that he uses his pencil and a paper to visualize what he is describing, and his handwriting is very ineligible and he has to erase so many times that I can't help but bother about the amount of eraser dust he produces. I wish he just uses a tablet when he wants to draw things.\r\n\r\nWhat I disliked the most was his lecture slides that he makes on his own, which severely lacked a lot of information. He seems to hate the lecture slides the CS department made but the department's slides are far more helpful. He doesn't record lectures because he wants to encourage students to attend to his lectures, so you kind of always have to attend his lectures since you will miss out a lot if you are absent as his lecture slides are lackluster, but frankly, if you study the department's slides, I don't think his lectures and slides were particularly helpful at all.\r\n\r\nAside from that, he is extremely unapproachable. I'm not sure if he is \"rude\" per se as I haven't had a proper conversation with him, and he can be pretty sweet like asking \"how are you?\" to his students, but when someone asks him questions, he can be really condescending. I think I asked him questions only two times throughout the semester, during the exam and after the lecture, and both of the times he was very cold. Maybe I was asking dumb questions to his eyes, because he does seem to love whenever his top students ask advanced questions during the lecture.\r\n\r\nI think he also makes his exams on his own, and in my opinion, those are much harder than the practice exams provided by the department. I did decently on the second midterm and the final exam, but I did pretty badly on the first midterm, which hurt my grade the most, because I had no idea his exams would be as difficult. I'm not saying his exams are the worst, but you definitely need to study consistently on everything that he covers, and he also teaches things that the department curriculum does not seem to include just because he \"likes\" those particular topics.\r\n\r\nHis projects are enjoyable though. You might not wrap your head around initially for some projects, but once you do, they're pretty easy to solve, and the GUI he makes for some projects are quite fun. I still can't figure out the solutions for his secret tests however...","1390":"Fawzi is a fantastic professor. Yes, he doesn't record lectures(unless on a religious holiday or if he is sick), but this encourages you to attend class and pay attention. His two midterms were COMPLETELY fair-game, and his final exam was difficult but was not as hard as I thought it would be. The secret to doing well in his course? Study his notes and lecture examples every day after class. His exam questions are ALWAYS based on his lecture examples and slides. Be diligent in your studying, and make use of his office hours, as they run 8-5, Monday-Friday, administered by TA's who are extremely knowledgeable and will help you with not only projects, but concepts as well that may seem confusing to you during lecture.","1391":"I struggled a bit with 131 as it was my first time coding so I was nervous going into 132 knowing it would be more difficult and cover far more complex topics. I thought Pedram did a great job explaining it and his code examples helped me learn it pretty seamlessly. I had to put way more time into the projects but it paid off because they were instrumental in how well I was able to understand concepts. He was also very helpful in the Q&A sessions and reviewed all the important material that we needed to know for tests and projects. Very great option in my opinion. ","1392":"He's good at explaining the concepts... but that's the only plus point I have for him. \r\nHe's got his TAs taking points off for missing a semicolon or parenthesis - that's not how coding works and losing points on things like that teaches you nothing relevant to being a programmer in the real world. He also speeds through his lectures and doesn't really save much time for answering questions. If you ask him a question outside the syllabus, a lot of the time his answer is 'I don't know.' Basically, he knows the material and not much past that. Also, he doesn't record his lectures so if you miss a class because you're sick or something like that, good luck catching up :( He isn't very understanding if you have to miss the weekly quiz (yes, there's a stressful quiz every week) for any reason that's not 'I'm severely ill' - he won't even reschedule. He also doesn't allow laptops in lectures - and taking handwritten notes for a CS class isn't really easy (in fact it doesn't make sense IMO). \r\nYou'll get the A if you work for it, but I know for a fact that you wouldn't have to work so hard if you managed to get a spot in one of Nelson's classes instead.","1393":"The GOAT TA","1394":"Had Brian as my TA for 132 over the summer, he was absolutely fantastic. Really great at explaining concepts, and just an overall great guy","1395":"This dude is amazing","1396":"Soooooooooooooo Maryland law requires me to inform you that Larry Herman is actually a pretty decent not-professor.\r\n\r\nIn all seriousness, he has his personality quirks, but I haven't found any faults in his teaching style or in his knowledge of the course material. The lecture slides cover pretty much everything you need to know and they include very helpful examples for Eclipse. Lectures are recorded and put on canvas.\r\n\r\nProjects are reasonable, his instructions are pretty long but they cover pretty much every edge case you need to consider. They are due roughly every week and a half or two weeks. I usually dedicated around 10 hours for each project, but of course this depends on its length. And he gives extra credit on a few of them if you just turn it in early.\r\n\r\nI disagree with the bottom review. I didn't do programming at all outside of class and I did fine. Of course, you should remember material from CMSC131\/AP Comp Sci A\/whatever, but he gives a pretty detailed review sheet and dedicates a few lectures at the beginning for this.\r\n\r\nHe doesn't allow electronics in class, going so far as to point people out from across the room who he thinks are on their phone, which a lot of people don't like. He also doesn't really like it when people take notes word-for-word off the lecture slides (this is not a good way to take notes, anyway). And his lectures can put people to sleep, but at least he's funny. If you can get past these things, though, and work diligently on the projects and studying for exams, you will do well.\r\n\r\nOverall, I'd highly recommend him, especially over a professor that's confusing but nice.","1397":"the best ta!!!! go to his office hours, you will not regret it, i went every week and it helped me so much! i'm not even in his section but i could never understand what any of the other tas were saying except for him so i started going specifically to see him, brian lau is so good at explaining ei don't think i would have passed the class without him. THIS MAN IS A LIFE SAVER!!!","1398":"He makes me want to fall asleep in his lecture. His projects are so complicated unnecessarily when compared to other professors.","1399":"Honestly, Larry is pretty underrated. \r\n\r\nPretty good lecturer, can be boring at times. He's strict about masks and electronic usage, but once you learn to really focus on the lecture it doesn't make much of a difference. He can be funny and does his best to make the class interesting.\r\n\r\nThe projects can be tedious but his descriptions are very good. The exams are very fair as long as you do the practice exams, worksheets, and stay on top of lectures. \r\n\r\nIf you're self-motivated, I highly recommend him.","1400":"Good teacher explains stuff well but doesn't u let use phone during class","1401":"She's a LOT better than people give her credit for. It can be difficult to understand her because of her accident, but that is where her faults end.\n\r\nShe puts a tremendous amount of effort into the course: she is even willing to print your homework out for you if you email it to her, and lets you turn it in overnight. She gives very reasonable test problems: if you practice with her provided material, the tests are easy. She makes it a very reasonable class.\n\r\nIf you cannot learn from her, read over the optional book instead. She goes over a lot of material, and makes you learn, while making it reasonable to learn.\n\r\nThe only other thing is she has a LOT of homework. It can be pretty annoying, but you'll get through it.","1402":"I did not enjoy this class, but I imagine that mostly stemmed from my dislike of the subject matter and my resentment for having to take the class. Gasarch is very enthusiastic and engaging (if you're willing to be engaged). If you're into math, definitely take him. If you're not, he's liable to get pretty grating by the end of the semester.","1403":"Gasarch is an incredible professor, with the ability to make a subject that I already had some familiarity with still more interesting.  His explanations of complex ideas and topics are very accessible, and his own knowledge of the subject is similarly impressive.  Given the speed with which he can explain a topic, we also had time to delve into some of Gasarch's own research, making the course a lot of fun.  Further, he will make sure every student is on track without slowing down the class, and in general makes going to class one of the more enjoyable parts of my day.","1404":"It's very important to accept that Kruskal simply operates on a different wavelength from the average person. He's a true mathematician in the sense that he experiences life abstractly and disregards some aspects of interaction in favor of maintaining his flow of reasoning.\n\r\nThe honors section was an intimate and fun experience, and I can see how Kruskal might be more difficult in a large lecture, or with students who are less enthusiastic or willing\/able to follow the material. So I highly recommend the honors class for the abstract-thinker. The assessments and graded assignments are the same, but you get to spend half the time solving logical puzzles.","1405":"Dr. Kruskal is awesome. He is an excellent instructor and he presents the material in his own way (which many people may not like). He is a mathematician and he loves math. For the most part in 250H we did not cover ANY of the material that we needed to cover (we had to read everything from the book) However, we spent the time doing special projects that were so much fun and interesting that it was worth having to read the book for the actual course material. The projects were not graded but you get to argue with and against Dr. Kruskal and he is so much fun to argue with. Overall, Dr. Kruskal is really passionate about his math and he is very funny. (He is a little bit forgetful and rarely answers to emails, but he's just awesome!)","1406":"AVOID. Unless you have SIGNIFICANT coding experience (I'm talking years of doing interview level coding in python NOT java), do not do this to yourself. He is a very smart guy and the content is very interesting but 70% of the class was his own personal math theorems, and the rest of the class was speeding or skipping over major curriculum content. We would cover 3 important topics in one lecture. Each homework was full of errors or misunderstandings and would take at least 15 hours (not exaggerating) and that was if you finally could figure it out. We got lucky with the TA supporting us and keeping things fair, but otherwise he should not be allowed to teach any course before CMSC330\/351. He is a funny and interesting guy however. The course would have been fine if he hadn't gone so fast and if the class in general had more comp-sci experience beforehand. ","1407":"She was the TA for CMSC250H and was honestly the best. She is a very kind person who truly does care a lot about her students. One of the best things about her is she understands everyone and their situations. She will schedule office hours with you outside of the office hour window if you are struggling. She will try and find any way to give you back points on exams and homeworks. She also is a very strong instructor and explains a lot of details in a very concise and simplistic fashion. You will not regret taking a class with her","1408":"I am gonna start with a disclaimer for this course in general. Seeing the CMSC250H, enticed me into the class because I thought, oh cool a CS honors class, that sounds like a cool experience. However, CMSC250H is quite a misleading name for this course. The name for this course should be MATH250H because this is almost entirely a math class (Discrete Mathematics: Proofs, inductions, probability, combinatorics).\r\n\r\nIn the honors version of the class, you go much faster on topics, you actually learn some coding stuff, and you do alot of problems related to Gasarch's books and research (the research part sounds cool at first, but as someone who finds math boring, it really isn't that fun). So every week we had a Honors homework assignment due Monday 9am sharp and a regular homework assignment \"due Monday 9am\", however Gasarch has this thing called \"dead cat policy\", which is essentially a free extension until Wednesday 9am (y'a know, incase your cat dies).\r\n\r\nThe homeworks are quite challenging intellectually, and studying\/working on them with classmates is the way to go. On that topic, the class is significantly smaller than the non honors section which is a good and bad thing. It's a good thing because you actually get to have a professor who knows what your name is and you get to meet some great friends who struggle with you. The bad thing is, this class essentially simulates a small pond environment, in which basically you are trapped in a class where 80% of the kids are geniuses and if you aren't a genius you constantly feel stupid.\r\n\r\nThe honors homeworks are honestly hit or miss. Most of the time they include a mini\/short coding project in which you could code in whatever language you wanted using whatever packages and etc you wanted (I used Java), these can get time consuming, but are usually much shorter than the regular homeworks. \r\n\r\nNote: Make sure you do your homework cause its like 30% of the grade and it really does come clutch in the gradebook. And also the homework is graded for accuracy so you do need to work hard on it, and it is great to have a study group to compare answers with.\r\n\r\nNow the exams. So in this semester what Gasarch did was he would often have a take home part and a non take home part. The take home part would be like 25-30 pts of the final and would usually take a long time to do. The timed part of the final would be 2 hours, and he would say they were open note and open internet (though the internet wouldn't really help). The exams were quite easy in comparison to the homework problems, however if you tripped up on a problem, you tend to fall. On the first midterm i got a 90 while the second i got a 70.\r\n\r\nNow as for Gasarch himself. This man is a straight up genius, which means if you aren't a genius, you will get lost often and quite fast in his words. He loves to crack jokes and be sarcastic which is a plus, but sometimes he is a straight up \"not nice guy\". If you give a wrong answer, he is the type of person to laugh at you, or lecture you about \"guessing\" (even though most of the class only answers by guesses) - happened to one of my friends, he is scarred for life now. I was once in a one on one zoom call with him talking about some problems and he was straight up being extremely rude to me and aggressive for almost no reason at all (maybe bad mood idk). He also 100% plays favorites so get on his good side. He goes at supersonic speed in his lectures, and doesn't do many practice problems so it is not fun trying to figure out what is even going on in the homework problems. In class we did a bunch of topics from his life's research, most notably, Muffin Mathematics, while memorable, can be quite tedious.\r\n\r\nThe TA for this class was honestly a saving grace and she helped us in so many ways (Thank you Emily). This class is definitely Hard, not impossible but definitely Hard. There will be times where you question why you took the honors section instead of the regular section - this happened to me a lot. But in the end of the class, Gasarch ended up giving an extremely generous curve (allegedly the TA had to convince him to give a curve) in which 85% curved to an A, 77-B,70-B-,60-C, no one got lower.\r\n\r\nSo I guess in the end, the honors section of this class is definitely challenging, however, you may actually end up with a higher grade than what you could have gotten in the regular section of this course and I definitely loved the small class size. Gasarch loves math, this course is not a CS course, it is a math course, he flies by the material and is definitely not the best at explaining advanced concepts (not to mention almost all his slides have like a million typos) for simple minds. If you are a math prodigy or are good with this stuff then you will cruise easily, if you aren't then this class will be a fight, but I definitely would take the honors section of this class again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","1409":"Gasarch is definitely going to present an intellectually harder course than the regular 250 section but I think he's worth it. You are forced to think creatively and out of the box which helps in other subjects. Also, his tests are not that hard.","1410":"Probably the most favorite CS class I've taken at UMD so far. As a disclaimer, this class probably doesn't prepare you well for 351 compared to regular 250 because of how fast-paced and how quickly topics are gone through, but 250H does go over necessary topics such as induction (at a much faster pace) so it's not a big deal at the end of the day. Gasarch is an incredibly intelligent professor who goes through topics very quickly, and he sometimes expects you to understand them immediately which may not be possible at all times. Another problem with this class at times is the number of typos or changes to the assignments which can get pretty annoying. This is probably the biggest downside to this class as you should expect every assignment or untimed midterm to have a few typos so make sure to send questions through Piazza or email if you see anything that is incorrect. At some point in the semester, you'll get used to it though so it shouldn't be a huge problem. It's also sometimes kind of difficult to wrap your head around the content because almost everything is published by Gasarch, so if you're unable to understand the topic, there isn't really a supplementary textbook or resource to go through. However, Gasarch and Emily are super accessible through email, office hours, and Zoom. They are understanding regarding questions involving course content, and grading is done fast. There are no minus grades given as well, and the cutoffs are usually lowered for an A, but it changes every semester based on the difficulty (88 this semester). Compared to previous years, I would have to say that 2022 was much easier. 250H is weird due to the fact that they are certain programming assignments that are given out. These are usually pretty easy and can be done quickly considering examples are given out for the code. I do recommend using Python because Java doesn't work without certain optimizations such as needing to use imports such as BigInteger to increase number thresholds, but I did use Java (wasn't as proficient at Python) and it's just a little more work compared to using Python, so if you don't know how to use Python don't worry. All assignments are to be done through a computer as Emily and Gasarch prefer to grade LaTeX documents (which you will learn how to use LaTeX through Overleaf) compared to handwriting. Untimed midterms are pretty chill as they're 50% of the grade with about a week to do, and for each of the timed exams, we're given 2 hours and 15 minutes to do which shouldn't take you that long as they are 3 questions each. Exams are open note and are done at night at 8 PM which can be sort of inconvenient, but Gasarch is a night-owl so it's whatever. To do well in this course, make sure you find a study group and work together on homework assignments. You don't have to be incredibly smart to do well in this course, but you need to do the work, and I recommend trying to score highly on the assignments are the exams\/midterms make up 65-70% of the class. Take advantage of Gasarch's dead-cat policy as he gives a two-day extension on almost every assignment, so if you have any questions after the weekend then you can ask in class before it's due. Make sure to show everything possible as tons of points can be taken off otherwise for not including simple and obvious steps as inferring without showing is not accepted. As a side note, Gasarch and Emily will bring in treats for certain occasions such as muffins for Muffin Math or chocolates just out of the blue, so that's a small bonus as well. The camaraderie is definitely one of the best parts of this class as it's very inclusive and everyone gets to know each other at a much deeper level. If you really match Gasarch's wavelength you can also end up playing certain games with him such as Dominion which was pretty cool. Overall, I highly recommend this class over regular 250, but only if you're committed to the work. You should end up getting a higher grade, significantly improve your mathematical maturity, and just learn more about discrete mathematics at a higher level.","1411":"Bill Pugh is one of the most famous (professionally) professors in CS dept. And he clearly knows his stuff very well. Unfortunately, you are not going to get much of it unless you make special efforts. He designed 433 in a slightly different way than described in the catalog; it was heavy on concurrent programming and we did very little on design patterns. I learned a lot in this course, but it was mostly by reading his slides and doing projects (one every week, and great fun). He isn't a very good grader; partial credit is hard to come by. Despite the fact that he is so knowledgeable, he won't make efforts to ensure students understand what he is talking about. He just reads through his slides and considers his job done. I would take this class with someone else if I can. But Pugh ain't that bad either.","1412":"Great professor, excellent teaching style and attitude. Very helpful with in class examples and study guides for exams.","1413":"Hicks is a nice person and a very reasonable professor who knows his stuff.","1414":"Awesome professor. Knows the material extremely well and very effective at teaching concepts.\n\r\nHe becomes disappointed when less than half the class shows up after the first midterm. Make sure you ask questions in class for him to remain engaged in explaining the examples.\n\r\nProjects are difficult and time consuming. The section with Yeh had OPEN note\/book\/internet\/anything midterms, which were held on google docs. Their class average was an 89, which is understandable since everyone gets 100% on his two midterms (worth 30% total).\n\r\nTake it with Yeh if you want to loaf around and still be able to pass. Take it with Porter if you want to learn concurrency and mapreduce.","1415":"Porter is a pretty cool guy.  The projects are kind of difficult, if only because his project descriptions are vague.  Make good use of the forum because he answers questions there frequently.  Exam(s) aren't too bad if you study.","1416":"Reasonable teacher:\r\nThe projects can be quite hard (though not impossible) and all the submit server tests are secret.\r\nExams are fair and graded fairly.\r\nLectures are boring -- Porter seemed to have lost interest in the material after the midterm because students had stopped coming to class.\r\nJust try a little harder and you'll get an A\/B","1417":"I like anwar and he keeps class fun but the material is just kinda boring so it is hard to pay attention sometimes. The class feels like just memorizing a bunch of java libraries used for multi threading. Easy Class though and projects are not too bad.","1418":"Funny stories, nice guy.  Class grades are pretty fair.\r\nProjects are kinda butt, and clicker questions suck, lectures are mediocre.  I also hate slide trivia exams (which is what he gives)","1419":"She's a bit hard to approach at first, but once you get to know her, she is excellent at explaining threading concepts. I hated threading from CMSC132, but she condensed it down to simpler terms for me to understand. Definitely recommend going to her!","1420":"I had Anwar for 433 and 330. He knows how to run a course well, curves fairly, and is generally pretty responsive to student concerns. I think he is a good standard that other UMD CS professors should hold themselves to. His slides are pretty good and his tests are fair.","1421":"Good professor that knows the material well. Mostly reads off slides but gives alot of examples which helped alot. TAs are very good and office hours provided alot of help on projects. Projects are standard and should be started when they are assigned. ","1422":"Anwar is fine. He explains the material decent enough in lecture, but he moves so fast! It's really hard to keep up with him during lectures. Also, the exams for CMSC433 are kind of really hard. I aced every single project but I couldn't for the life of me manage better than a 71 on the midterm. I don't expect to do much better on the final. All in all, Anwar is just okay. Not the worst CMSC professor I've ever had but certainly far from the best.","1423":"Pretty good 400 class overall. I don't think Anwar is a good lecturer, but he's pretty accommodating by making clicker questions fairly easy and worth 5% of the final grade to redistribute from exams. Some projects were tough (akka), especially due a high amount of the grade being secret tests, but others were fine. Make sure you put time into them, since they're worth a lot, and if you do you should be able to get a good grade. \r\nI thought the midterm and the final were fine, since I found them to be somewhat modeled after old exams. Also, TAs were great; they were really responsive on Piazza (much more than other 400s) and helpful for office hours. Great slides, and the material itself is also quite useful. Thus, if Anwar is teaching this class, I'd recommend taking it with him. ","1424":"Not great lecturing style IMO. Lots of \"you know?\" \"this stuff\" \"this thing\" \"this stuff is tricky\" \"just read the JavaDoc\". Little motivational content to introduce concepts, which I've always found very useful in CMSC. Absolutely flies through examples without prefacing them well. Much prefer Dr. Hicks or even Prof. Herman hyper-explicit lecturing style and projects.\r\n\r\nProjects are open-ended and almost guaranteed to be 75% or more secret tests. TAs are exceptional but projects will still take 15-30 hours for average student, which was hell for someone balancing career responsibilities and other CMSC4xx classes as well. Midterms were fair and lecture slides were good.\r\n\r\nMain complaints are lecturing style and project difficulty\/disconnect from lecture material\/lack of direction given in description.\r\n\r\nDo not let this review discourage you from taking 433 with Anwar if you enjoy his style or are simply... well... smarter than me. Anwar is cool but the class just did not resonate with me. I've heard he's pretty good for 330 though.","1425":"Second class with Anwar and he's a great professor. His exams are pretty easy for the most part since he emphasizes more on projects (which I 100% agree with). The projects in the class range from extremely easy (Hadoop and MPI) to challenging (Akka), but they're all good skills to know. I didn't attend lecture live as he uploaded the recording, and he does fly through the material, but the slides and GitHub repository provide enough examples to help you understand the material.","1426":"If you think Kruskal was bad, this man is worse. There is no help in this class, and on top of that there are no online resources. The only way to pass is to bug the TAs for answers","1427":"Very difficult professor to understand in class.\r\nCondescending when students reach out for help.\r\nto quote liyi\r\n\"Just finish it today. It is very easy. Even easier than I thought.\"","1428":"PROS:\r\n- course content is not difficult; the sheer amount of assignments is what makes the class difficult\r\n- Professor Li is VERY responsive on Piazza. Between the professor and the TAs, posts usually don't sit unanswered for more than a few hours. Same goes on weekends too, though maybe a longer response time\r\n- Lectures are recorded and are posted to elms with the slides\r\n- online + open notes exams\r\n\r\nCONS: \r\n- Each week you'll either have 2 or 3 things due or nothing due. If there's nothing due one week there's a big project due the following week.\r\n- Your learning will come from the TAs office hours and learning on your own because the lectures provide little to no educational value. \r\n- His accent makes things impossible to understand. Doesn't apply to project descriptions though because he took them from Dr. Mamat.\r\n- Concurrency is only a small fraction of the course, but there are some other interesting concepts \r\n- Course is pretty unorganized\r\n- Straight up doesn't understand some of the concepts himself. There have been a few times where he answer questions in lecture\/on piazza with \"I don't know\".","1429":"Please Please Please stay away from this professor. He makes the courses harder than it should be. TA's are not helpful because they don't even know it themselves. The professor doesn't help you either. You literally are left alone to die. Only take this course if you want to test hell.","1430":"Good professor, definitely knows his material. Goes a bit fast, so if you can't keep up, definitely ask questions - he likes questions.","1431":"Really enjoyed his lectures. He knows this stuff really well and can explain ANYTHING.\n\r\nProjects:\r\nWe had 3 projects, the first and last were pretty hard. You should definitely start early on these graphics projects because most of the time the language you use (OpenGL with C++) won't tell you what mistake you made, it will just produce a blank image. I had a lot of fun working on these projects.\n\r\nHW: \r\nWe were supposed to have 2 homeworks, but it was reduced to one because of project difficulty. The homework was like mini-projects and some linear algebra stuff. While I am on that topic I would like to say that you really should have a basic understanding of linear algebra to understand how things work in this course. It won't matter much for projects, but it will matter for exams and just being able to understand how OpenGL works.\n\r\nExams:\r\n1 Midterm, 1 Final. He gives about 10 practice problems in preparation for the exams and if you can get through those you'll be in pretty good shape. The final had some trickier problems than the midterm (the final really tests your in depth knowledge of graphics combined with linear algebra).\n\r\nLecture Notes: \r\nHe posts awesome lecture notes online. You can pretty much just read these, but  there are places in the lecture notes where he puts things like \"Can you think of why this is true?\" or \"What would happen if we used a cone instead of a sphere?\". We always discuss these questions in class and they seem to have a habit of showing up on homework or exams. \n","1432":"Dave Mount is a really good professor simply because of two things: he knows graphics well, and he is exceptional at teaching. \n\r\nWhile there are many professors in CS dept who know their stuff, most suck at teaching. Mount, on the other hand, takes a lot of pain to make sure people understand the concepts. And the best part was that he did entire class on white-board. Graphics can be a hard class to teach on the board because it involves so many 3D drawings and stuff, but Mount stuck to doing everything on the board, and that just made his lectures very effective.\n\r\nThere are legends about his lecture notes -- other professors like Meesh use his notes for their classes. We had great lecture notes for this class that included everything he went over in class. Yet, it was still useful to come to class because his teaching style meant that you needed to do very little preparation for the tests.\n\r\nThere were four projects, which did a good job covering most of the important topics we discussed in class. The project difficulty level was about medium. \n\r\nHis final was harder than the midterm, but neither was long. This class is great fun in general, and it was quite an experience with Dr. Mount. Strongly recommended!","1433":"Professor Gasarch does a great job in lecture and is always willing to help his students reach reach an understanding of the material that he talks about in class (some of which is definitely not easy).\n\r\nThere were numerous times during the semester where Gasarch could be found in his office well after his stated office hours answering student questions and giving homework hints. He is very responsive to email as well. I would highly recommend professor Gasarach although it is definitely true that a strong math background would be very helpful for his course.","1434":"Lecutre:\r\nGasarch is a good lecturer. He will try to get you involved and questions are always welcome. He makes lecture a little more interactive than most professors. He also talks fast, which might take you a week to get used to.\n\r\nBook:\r\nHe lists 4 books that are all optional. I bought the \"Introduction to the Theory of Computation\" by Sipser book and really liked it. I would definitely suggest it if you think you will need a book for this course.\n\r\nHW:\r\nAfter having Kruskal for cmsc250&351 I was used to HW's being impossibly difficult. This is (thankfully) not true in Gasarch's class. Most of the problems are of medium difficulty, with a scattering of very hard and really easy. If the problem seems really easy then it probably is, don't second guess yourself.\n\r\nContent: \r\nBeware, I found the second half of the course (Decidability & NP\/P stuff) to be very hard, and I think most people would agree. For those wondering the first half of the course was on Finite Automaton, Regular Languages, DFA\/NFA\/Regex\/CFG. \n\r\nExams:\r\nMidterm: 35% of grade\r\nFinal: 41% of grade\r\nMidterm was fairly easy as long as you knew understood everything, he will ask you to explain what you are doing, not just do it (this is so you don't just blindly follow the algorithms). \r\nFinal was harder as it tested the NP\/P etc. stuff. \r\nYou get a cheat sheet mainly so you don't have to memorize the algorithms. \n\r\nFinally:\r\nI took this course concurrently with CMSC330 and I think it actually gave me an advantage in both courses. Since I read the first two chapters of the Sipser book the week before school started I was not behind in 452 and the work we did in 452 really helped me when we formally covered DFA\/NFA in 330.","1435":"Gasarch is an interesting individual but makes the class a lot of fun. He's much more interested in students understanding the material than he is in grades or teaching style. \r\n\r\nHe's pretty fair with homeworks and tests and usually if you know how to do all of the homeworks you will do fine on the test.\r\n\r\nHe goes very fast during lecture but will try to slow down if someone asks. Sometimes he's a bit insensitive with what he says but is generally very nice.","1436":"A good lecturer that talks about interesting (and arguably obscure) topics. The biggest complaint I have is that his notation is usually odd and confusing (coming from a more formal mathematical background) and inconsistent, and things are sometimes hand-waved. \r\n\r\nTo give a specific example, we went over the pumping lemma, and the only limitation he gave was that it applied to strings which are \"long enough\". No justification for what that meant. I had to learn the pumping lemma myself more rigorously outside of class to understand what the formal restrictions are on the strings it applies to.\r\n\r\nHe's also a very eccentric guy. Not that I minded; I actually found it a little endearing. ","1437":"Nice enough person, but a poor instructor.\n\r\nHis teaching style is to read over his lecture slides (which, granted, are packed with information) pretty much word for word. I found in-class lectures pretty pointless unless you managed to immediately digest and comprehend information at the (pretty quick) rate at which he presents it, and ask tons of questions. You'd be better off pulling up the lecture slides on your own and working through the examples during class time. \n\r\nHomework sets took a bit of time to do, since there was a fair amount of having to review the slides repeatedly and first trying to understand the examples and reverse engineer them. Practice Midterm and Final Exams were given, but were much easier than the actual ones. Nau's justification was that they were all of 'easy' difficulty for him, so he didn't realize ours was harder.\n\r\nFinal grades in this class were curved, in my opinion heavily (~8-10%). The projects are not of complex difficulty and ended up bringing up most people's grades in this class, at least a little bit.","1438":"I really enjoyed this class. Stevens clearly put in the time for each lecture, and made the class interesting, with lots of live coding examples. Plenty of supplemental material to go along with the lectures as well, and VERY generous with how the class was graded. I'm talking getting a grade back, being permitted to fix the problems, and resubmitting for FULL POINTS. He did reverse curve at the end of the semester (which was scandalous and caused a huge conflict), but honestly, just doing the minimum on the assignments and the easy exams netted me a 97 in the class. I don't consider myself a genius either. The only reason he upcurved is because everyone was doing so well in the class. Highly recommend him as a professor, and I would definitely take him again.   ","1439":"Do not trust these IGNORANT 1-star reviews. He upcurved because this was the easiest class in all of existence. HE LETS YOU REDO PROJECTS FOR FULL CREDIT. If you get a bad grade on a project you can just resubmit a week after the deadline for full credit. All of his projects are super straight forward and he has great informative lectures. Rubrics were super straight forward and his exams were also very straight forward (one exam which is a 40 question online assignment with no time limit). He was super nice and down to Earth, not pretentious like some ignorant people say. The midterm wasn't even an exam it was just a project that he gave you 2 weeks to do. He also records all of his lectures. \r\n\r\nStevens was by far the best CS professor I have ever had. Anyone who tells you otherwise is just mad they didn't take advantage of his resubmit policy because they didn't think he would up curve even though resubmit policy is so BS and overly benefits the student. I didn't even need to use the resubmit policy because the projects were so straightforward and easy to understand and do.","1440":"Curving backwards is unacceptable, a teacher should not move the goalpost and suddenly tell students the grade they've been working towards is now a different grade. A LOWER grade.\r\nAlso I'm 99% sure Miller wrote those good reviews himself:\r\n1) They're both posted on the same day\r\n2) Who writes a review the day before the next semester starts, and the class has been over for 4 weeks\r\n3) If you go to rate my professor there is another good review posted, what do you know, the same day as the good reviews here.\r\n\r\nMan has to write his own good reviews.","1441":"This is the definition of a 2-star class. The material was original and the lectures were just interesting enough to keep me from withdrawing.\r\n\r\nThe class is terribly organized for the following reasons:\r\n1. Homework assignments are out of between 4 and 7 points, so when you lose half a point on a question, it turns out to be around 10% of the total grade for the assignment, even if your mistake isn't that big.\r\n2. Assignments are graded without any indication of what you lost points for (rubric not filled out and no comments), so for each assignment, you have to make a piazza post asking where you lost points. Archaic and pointless way of doing things. Also, they don't post solutions for most of the homework assignments.\r\n3. You have two days to request a regrade on assignments, which is unreasonably short when they don't post solutions and you have to ask what you lost points on.\r\n4. You're only allowed one submission per assignment, so if you submit and then realize you did something wrong you're out of luck, even though the deadline hasn't passed yet.\r\n5. You'll lose points on questions if your answers contain too much information. Whatever that means.\r\n6. During some of the synchronous lectures, he just played recordings of his previous lectures, which is fine, but why hold synchronous classes if you're barely going to interact with the students?\r\n7. While my class didn't seem to experience a downward curve (perhaps even a slight upward curve?), the possibility of having one is absolutely ridiculous. It really just exemplifies how poorly organized this class is. If the students do well on the assignments, they should get the grades they earned, and if the assignments are easy enough that everyone aces them, make them harder. Don't leave me guessing whether I'll be bumped down a grade because you're having a bad day.\r\n8. Somehow after all the assignment grades were in, it took them over a week to put in final grades, which was incredibly stressful given the lack of transparency regarding the curve.\r\n9. There was no mention of redoing assignments for full credit, so I'm not sure where the previous reviews got that from, but this was the summer session, so that could be part of it.\r\n\r\nNo single point is that bad on its own (except maybe curving down), but it's infuriating to deal with poor organization in every part of this class. Game programming is cool, and I learned a bunch, but it wasn't really worth the stress and poor organization.","1442":"CMSC320: really interesting lectures imo. Apparently lots of people disagree, as very few people attended lecture (maybe 25%? of ~180). He was pretty lenient on assignments: he gave extensions on ~50% of the projects due to people asking on piazza.","1443":"Pros: Was a really, really nice guy when I went to talk with him during his office hours.  You can tell he's very knowledgeable in his field.  He is also the most lenient grader I've ever seen (apart from Meesh) and gives a lot of extra credit.\r\n\r\nCons: His lectures were pretty horrible. They were very hard to follow and required that you knew a lot about statistics going into the class (he mumbles a lot and tends to gloss over the basics).  Calculus based statistics is basically a hidden prereq for this course, which sucks because I didn't take calculus based statistics.  The biggest problem I had with him as a professor is that I actually didn't learn anything all semester.  I honestly don't know any more now than when I started this class.  He is a lenient grader, but what that really means is that you can basically stop going to class and BS every assignment and still come out of the class with a decent grade.  I got a B, but I did NOT deserve a B.\r\n\r\nI will say that I learned some VERY basic stuff about the R language, but that's about it. I didn't learn the stats, I didn't learn the ML, I learned how to pretend I knew stats and ML.","1444":"Hector is a decent guy and research professor, but he's honestly a horrible lecturer. My friend (who was a TA for the class) hyped up this class a lot, and it was a big disappointment.\r\n\r\nAbout 75% of students stopped going to class after a few weeks because his lectures were fast-paced, hard to follow, and he mumbles\/glosses over important concepts. Nobody tells you that calculus-based stats is a needed prereq for this course, and on top of that, Hector uses his own statistical notation in his notes (which often differs from the standard). The bi-weekly homeworks aren't too bad, but his exams are conceptual and weirdly difficult.\r\n\r\nBe warned - it's hard to learn anything from this class. If you take it, make sure it's on a semester when Hector teaches Python (R is useless the way he teaches it). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","1445":"Projects are not too bad. One midterm, really hard because he doesn't provide study materials for it. great class","1446":"Great Professor Overall - went over content in depth but well. Was a bit hard to ask questions in a big lecture hall, but I don't think that's on him. Projects were interesting and overall a good class.","1447":"Took him for CMSC320. Went to lecture even though almost everybody else didn't. He would go over about 6 slides in an hour and 15 mins. He just was bad in all respects. He was a nice guy, probably a good coder, just not a good professor.","1448":"10\/10 would recommend this Prof. CMSC320 with him is very interesting. Projects actually helped me learn a lot of Python and ML stuff. ","1449":"honestly i did not learn much from his lectures. i mean i looked at his slides and learned but i don't really like his lecture style. i stopped going after the midterm since there's no final exam. the TAs were sometimes very unresponsive on piazza and the projects are veryyyy vague and can be unclear what they want. then when you do what they want, they take more points off because of \"requirements\" that weren't even mentioned in the description(this didn't happen to me but some other people). overall if you have to take 320 it honestly doesn't matter, i wouldnt go out of my way to avoid dickerson and he's a pretty nice person and has done a lot of great work\/projects(check his kidney transplant scheduling..thing) but i didnt really like the experience of 320. ","1450":"Course size is way too large. Dickerson is a good lecturer, but I think the the course covers too much material overall. Learned a bit of python and pandas, and projects were okay.","1451":"Really liked the structure of the class. 4 projects, a midterm and a final project, along with weekly quizzes online. The material is interesting, however does not go super in depth. Slides are posted on the class page and contain all the information you need to know very thoroughly","1452":"He's a good lecturer and a nice guy, but it's almost impossible to reach him by Piazza or email because he barely ever responds to anything. TAs similarly were very unresponsive on Piazza, and he and the TAs were super late\/negligent on giving help and practice material.  For our midterm, we barely got any test practice and what we did get was only a few days before the exam. This may probably be benefited by having more TAs in this class.  Also, project descriptions were vague and full of errors. \r\nDespite this though, the grading is very lenient on the projects and final once you put in the work, so I'd probably still recommend him over the other guy (Hector). ","1453":"Not the worst CS professor I have had, but I wasn't impressed. Lectures often delved into hard to follow free-hand mathematical derivations that he would speed through (especially true for the latter half of the class that was focused on ML algorithms). I often felt confused after lectures and bored midway through.  I found understanding in the material through reading lecture slides for some of the topics. Lecture slides for ML algorithms (ie linear regression, KNN, decision trees, random forests, etc) were confusing and I got a way better understanding by watching youtube videos on relevant topics. The midterm was ridiculously difficult which was annoying; the average was pretty low. Projects are interesting in my opinion; I really enjoyed the web scraping project. It was a great introduction to the topic. All projects were written in Python. I can say I gained a lot of worthwhile experience with relevant data science Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and others. I would take this class again but I cannot say I recommend this professor.","1454":"Great professor, cares about his students and is chill during class.","1455":"I had an amazing time in Professor Calderon's class, I believe he is easily one of the best undergraduate CS professors at UMD.\r\nI took this class in Spring 2021.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n+ Infectious passion about data science, very easily bleeds into his teaching style\r\n+ Extremely intelligent regarding course material. It is very obvious this isn't his first rodeo\r\n+ Does his best to make even the most complex material digestable and easy to understand\r\n+ Answers any and all questions regarding lecture content and project questions\r\n+ Tests and projects are fair\r\n+ Plenty of extra credit opportunities\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Lectures would occasionally go long (although this was rarely an issue)\r\n- This is barely a con, more a given of most upper level classes, but there is no late deadline; either it's on time, or a 0. However, I would hardly call this unfair, there is plenty of notice as to when projects are due.","1456":"Probably the best CS teacher I've ever had at UMD. I'll just say this - if this dude was my professor for every single CS class, my life at UMD would have been much easier and so would my GPA. \r\n\r\nEverything from the quiz policies to the lecture slides were just right. All you had to do to pass quizzes was get 3\/5 questions right. The lecture slides were very helpful too because I barely attended any Zoom lectures (only like 1 or 2 lol) and only caught up by skimming over the slides (not that I recommend you do the same) and still was able to have a solid grasp of the material and get an A+ final grade. Furthermore the take-home midterm was a piece of cake. He is extremely understanding - I had some issues at the deadline for projects but he was very lenient about extensions. Don't hesitate at all to take this course with Jose, you will learn a lot about an extremely important field from a super chill teacher while not having a heavy workload and the stress that comes with it.","1457":"Simply fantastic when it comes to lecturing and organizing class materials. He was also a lenient grader and always reachable during this last online semester. ","1458":"This class is much harder than it needs to be because of how disorganized it is. The lectures cover maybe 10% of what you need to know for projects. John and the TAs rarely answer questions on Piazza, and when they do they're usually not helpful. There are basically no practice materials for exams, or even general information on what topics are covered. Project descriptions are extremely vague and ambiguous.","1459":"Very fair teacher, but lectures are pretty boring. Projects take a long time but are not very complicated. Class is very slow at grading so you will not know how you did on a project for at least a month.","1460":"Absolutely ridiculous how long it takes a project to get graded.","1461":"Dickerson is a nice and approachable professor. However, I found that the projects were unecessarily difficult and took a long time to complete. The TAs weren't very helpful, so this class ended up taking a lot more time than expected. The grading is also pretty slow. However, Dickerson did a good job teaching and was generally quite engaging. The final project, which requires making a tutorial, was a great resume builder and was fun to work on. ","1462":"Firstly, hes a pretty young and chill guy. His lecture topics are relevant and he makes the course in Python so that you can actually benefit from the material in the class. The course itself is actually kind of interesting. Now here is the kicker, it takes a CENTURY for him to grade stuff. The projects themselves are quite time consuming, and I had to google how to do half the shit on the projects because he makes them so you learn as you go. There are about 4 TA's in the class and they tend to be not helpful themselves. He gave us 2 mid term exams, one which was kinda hard, while the other which was kinda easy. Though he gives no practice, so you do not know how to study for any of his exams. He is also an awful communicator to the point where he avoids questions on piazza because he simply doesnt feel like answering them. Ive seen him answer like 2 questions and then ignore all the others. For our Final Project (no final exam), he is independently grading all of them so obviously it may take a bit, but he essentially just assigned us grades on testudo and didnt even tell us what we got on our final projects. When asked on piazza about it, he has been stone cold silent. We did not get our project 3\/4 grades until the day before our Final Project was due. We got our project 2 grades the week before that. Keep in mind these projects were due like months before.","1463":"Honestly, I was pretty excited for this class, but I was disappointed this semester. As others said, Dickerson is a nice guy and he's a decent lecturer. I found the lecture content, however, to be boring. Perhaps this was just me excepting data science to be less math oriented and theoretical. The lectures would sometimes seem to be overly complicated. The content that you learned in lectures barely helped for the projects. I remember being quite frustrated by the first project because I was going through slides and I didn't know how to do it. Once you realize that the projects are a lot of Googling how to use the tools they give you (such as Pandas and numpy), they become pretty easy. Even though they were easy, the projects were tedious and uninteresting, and they do take quite a bit of time. I expected more of a coding class, but you have to explain and analyze a lot of things in your project (which is I guess how data science is, but I found it uninteresting). There's only four projects, however, and the fourth one (the map one) was pretty short and interesting. The projects were graded leniently, with averages in the high 90s, but they took way too long to grade them. The midterms didn't end up being too difficult, but he had basically no practice material. It'll probably get better as time goes on since he'll just re-use old exams as practice, but I had no idea how to prepare for his midterms. Since the projects have basically nothing to do with lecture, I stopped going after the second midterm (there's no final exam, just a final project). He has you do weekly reading quizzes and they were pass\/fail, so they were pretty much free points. The final project is basically what you make out of it. It's a great opportunity to put something meaningful on your resume as someone down below said, but I ended up doing something much easier for a good grade. Still, it's very open-ended and a great idea.\r\n\r\nEven with all my complaints, the class itself wasn't very difficult to be honest. Dickerson is a nice guy and a decent lecturer, and you will be be fine if you take a class with him.","1464":"Hands down the best CS professor I have ever had. Very engaging lectures, fair exams, and challenging (but interesting) projects. ","1465":"Did a good job with the course although the content and lecture was kind of boring at times. Projects and exams weren't too bad.","1466":"DO NOT take this class with Maksym Moraswki. His lectures is interesting but has nothing to do with our project\/exam. His project description does not match how he grade it.","1467":"Love how the rate my prof ratings are so much better. https:\/\/www.ratemyprofessors.com\/professor?tid=1822434. \r\nExam wasn't that bad as long as you listen to what he says in class. He doesn't always teach everything in lectures, a lot of self learning is expected of you as well; however, he always points out the topics you have to self learn. It is very clear and probably like an hour of learning outside of class a week.","1468":"He doesn't know how to teach. He deleted all lecture slides from the previous semester which are rather clear and useful, and teach classes without slides. He also canceled a bunch of classes without trying to make up.","1469":"Classroom lectures, while interesting, aren't relevant at all to what's actually on the exam, and concepts that are briefly glossed over in class show up as a full-fledged exam question. Nothing in class is really relevant to the knowledge needed to complete the projects past the first couple of lectures.","1470":"I learned nothing from his class.","1471":"Horrible professor contingent on making your life as confusing and miserable as possible. First exam was a complete crapshoot, so bad in fact that there was not even a GradeScope timer. Genuinely ignore the 5 star review. I ended up with above a 100% on the exam after this curve to compensate how horrible the exam was (removed 10 points from a 42 exam) and I'm telling you he's horrible. Quite horrible.","1472":"Great guy, very funny, clearly has experience with what he is teaching. While the first midterm we had did have some more vague questions, it was graded very fair with a curve and numerous questions converted to extra credit. Lectures don't always line-up exactly with projects\/exams but are interesting in useful in overall terms for data science. Would guarantee most of the reviews on here that are negative are people who aren't putting in effort\/starting projects last minute, etc. Would highly recommend for anyone interested in data science and would advise to take most of these negative reviews with a grain of salt\/open mind","1473":"Max is a really nice guy and on the first day of class got me excited about the course by telling some very interesting stories about his time in the industry. This was the first time in a CS class that I had been excited to learn or thought to myself, \u201cwow that sounds like something I want to do when I graduate.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat is why I\u2019m extra disappointed by this class. I suspect that all the Max does to prepare for each day is make a general list of things he wants to talk about and the occasional very plain PowerPoint which he doesn\u2019t stick to. What happens in class is that he simply rambles about said topics without any semblance of structure. There are no key points even if he is using a visual aid. Max will often hand write notes but this is pretty spotty and no one would be able to understand the full picture if they were to try to go back and look at the notes. It is often as if his lectures are simply a conversation between him and people sitting in the front row which quickly breaks down the flow of class and creates too many tangents. It also reveals how unprepared he is when people ask questions and he realizes he should have planned to address that but that it had slipped his mind. This is only a small summary of the issues in this class. Projects are way too hard in comparison for how casually he teaches and test questions seem to be first drafts without any revision. Unless you have the time or personality that would allow you to live in his office hours, don\u2019t expect to get much from Max because his lectures are very difficult to learn from.","1474":"easy class, only con is you have to take it with Max. Fun if you want to hear a tech bro boast about his salary every lecture","1475":"This review is after Maks addressed what has happened in the class and the midterm recently, which is why you are going to wonder why all the 1 star reviews.\r\nI do agree that he isn't the greatest lecturer, and that a lot of topics that he very lightly brushed on the exam came in full force in the midterm, however I am posting this after he gave an EXTREMELY generous curve and on top of that he admitted that a lot of the questions that seemed out of scope of the class or  that were badly written, well that was actually the case, and he made it up within the curve that he gave us.\r\n\r\nIt's his first time teaching this course, not sure if actually it's his first time lecturing huge sections, and actually. I was frustrated too with his lectures but I can see why he wants us to learn all of this and he is trying to re-make the class. It's to get us to think data-wise and not just be code monkeys who just do python,sql, and stuff to whatever we are told to do for the projects. He is a caring and great guy and I have never seen instructors be so caring to the point of admitting their own mistakes and taking student input in order to improve.\r\n\r\nThere could be more in depth examples and case scenarios for the next exams theory\/stat\/math wise, and perhaps include a bit of the project stuff in class, but he is great and trying his best at getting us to get the most out of this course.","1476":"The way that CMSC320 is being taught in the fall 2022 is a disaster. \r\nThe class was known as a easy CMSC elective class. But it is not this semester. Morawski is a cool, fun guy. Maybe caring according to my friends, but he is far away from good professor this semester. \r\nHe has a few little lecture slides at the beginning of the semester, but no more after he decided to remake the class. We get speaker notes sometimes, but it is only converging the topics he went over. Furthermore, the lectures he gave doesn't teach us how to do our projects and exams well. We basically need to learn how to do the project on our own - it is much workload that I was expecting for CMSC320. It is probably the workload similar to CMSC216. BTW I start projects early so I can ask TA for help, but they are still time consuming and suffering because you have to find out what are expecting (the project description doesn't always tell you where you graded on) and teach yourselves (since you didn't really learn how to do the project yourself)\r\nAlso, I do agree that he is trying to make \"us to think data-wise and not just be code monkeys\". But we need to think data-wise AND how to code.  \r\nMany of the exams questions went far away from the scope of the class. And some are bad written. The projects we did (and cmsc320 is project heavy class) probably worth 6 points in the 42 points exam (which is 32 after he gave curve). Also there is no timer on the gradescope when we took the exam so we will realize \"we had to time ourselves!\" after you read the exam starts 3-5 mins. \r\nHe might improve next semester (Spring 2023) based on the feedback he got this semester, but honestly, if you have choice, try to wait a semester to see how it went . At this point, I will say he is definitely 1\/5 at CMSC320. If you have to, I will suggest to treat this class not as elective CMSC class that is kinda easy as the previous reviews have, treat it as a CMSC216 class that will took your lots efforts to get A.","1477":"I really enjoy his class. He makes the material fun and engaging, and added a lot of real world applications to our lessons.\r\n\r\nThis is his first semester teaching it, and so it's a bit bumpy because of the transition to new material, but he's been doing his best to make it smooth and respond to student feedback","1478":"Really gracious curve and very responsive to feedback. Really interesting class.","1479":"The main issue is poor organization in lecture. Does not provide clear explanations of each topic nor specific examples. Hand written notes are his passing thoughts rather than coherent, structured notes. I often leave class feeling as if I learned nothing. I struggle to take notes because of lack of structure in lectures. Exam was not very relevant to what was covered in lecture, but he is working on this for the next one! Lectures are not really related to the projects.\r\n\r\nDespite all this, Max is a funny and really cool dude. I enjoy talking to him and hearing his thoughts and stories. It's obvious he's working to improve. I appreciate he has industry experience, which he ties to what we're learning!\r\n\r\nMy recommendations for improvement: \r\n- Organize lectures with clear explanations of each data science technique, use cases, and relevant examples. \r\n- Create more organized hand written notes that can serve as a reference. \r\n- Review key concepts necessary for projects and exams.\r\n- Keep sharing cool stories and industry insights!","1480":"Everyone who gave him a 5 star review doesn't understand that just by curving an exam by 30% makes you a better professor. His lectures are still uninteresting, he goes on niche tangents with 3 kids in the class that make lecture an unbearable nightmare where you don't learn anything. I'm willing to bet that the 3 people who gave him those 5 star reviews are the same people who sit front of the class asking him questions to get him to go on random tangents for 90 minutes.","1481":"Really nice guy passionate about data science. Not a good teacher. If you want to self-teach yourself all of the content in this course then take Maks. His lectures are hard to follow as they involve at least 3 tangents minimum. He is not organized and it is very unclear on how much we need to know about mentioned topics. This makes studying almost impossible. I only did well on the first exam due to prior knowledge and google. I would recommend taking this class with someone else and make your life easier.","1482":"Take it with someone else if you actually want to learn something. He's a nice guy, but doesn't really teach anything substantial that's useful for the projects and exams. He talks about various topics at a very surface level but doesn't go into any of the details. The first exam was just STAT 400 questions and student-made questions from Piazza. Also the things we were tested on he didn't really go into much detail in in lecture. Only thing that I have found valuable from this class so far are the projects created by previous professors for the course.","1483":"Professor Max is a super down to earth dude. I personally really enjoy his class and he makes lectures fun. \r\n\r\nThe way he is teaching CMSC320 is unusual but it comes from a person who has worked in the field, which holds a lot of value in my eyes. \r\n\r\nProjects: not easy but he is reusing projects from other semesters so I don\u2019t understand why people are complaining. A lot of project work is fully self taught, which isn\u2019t unusual for CS courses. The project grading is lenient and Max is super easy to talk to if you have any issues. If you don\u2019t want to self learn then you are going to have a lot of trouble in various CS courses, it\u2019s just how it is unfortunately \r\n\r\nExam 1: This exam was online so we had access to Google and any notes we had taken. The average was around 65% but Max is giving us a generous curve and again, none of this is unusual for a CMSC course, it\u2019s only really bad if the professor isn\u2019t fair with curving based on the averages, which is not the case here. There were technical difficulties but Max accommodated for that and helped anyone that had issues. Also, the vast majority of the grade comes from projects so this isn\u2019t even a big deal\r\n\r\nLectures: Max talks about the fundamental topics briefly and doesn\u2019t go into too much detail. Again, most of the code you will learn is self taught and contained in the projects, lecture is for high level explanations of the different topics of the course. Max also shares stories about projects he had to do in industry and problem solving techniques he used to get his solutions. All very practical and useful information. if you\u2019re a geek that doesn\u2019t care about real life and want to stuff your face in a text book and fully learn everything in depth, this gem of a lecturer isn\u2019t for you. \r\n\r\nOverall thoughts: I personally think this class is a breath of fresh air amongst the sea of boring and difficult computer science courses. Max actually makes me want to come to lecture as opposed to feeling like I have to. I love having professors that are easy to talk to and feel more down to earth. This is definitely one of the rare instances of a professor that understands that students have a life outside of their course and is willing to accommodate for real excuses. \r\n\r\nOther ratings: I honestly feel like Max is getting a lot of unfair reviews. This is his first semester teaching the course and he is demonstrating a clear willingness to learn and improve as a professor. There are lots of complaints about the unorganized lecture styles, which is a fair criticism that I\u2019m sure he will address in the future, but also bs criticism about an exam that isn\u2019t worth very much of our grade and projects that he didn\u2019t even write? These are literally reused projects from other semesters so if that\u2019s the complaint then you have a problem with the class, not Max. There seems to be two sides to this. If you want to hear real life experiences and get advice about how to make it in the industry, then you\u2019ll like Max. If you\u2019re looking for a professor that solely focuses on teaching the class material, then Max is not for you.\r\n\r\nConclusion: He a little confused but he got the spirit","1484":"Great professor that is a little unorganized but makes up for it with real life industry work experience. Max shares his work stories about projects he did and how he did them, which is a lot more valuable to me then just coursework\r\n\r\nMax is a breath of fresh air in the sea of super boring work heavy CMSC courses, love the dude\r\n\r\nThis is his first semester teaching the course and he is very gracious with curves and listens to student concerns. Super down to earth dude. Some technical difficulties in the class but he\u2019s working on them \r\n\r\nOverall: he a little confused be he got the spirit","1485":"Has a super fun personality. Unfortunately, this personality also involves him being incredibly hand-wavy for just about every topic, making it impossible to do the projects or the exams without literally learning all of the details and processes (which are deemed uncool) yourself. This is made more difficult by the fact that he's thrown out all of the previous relatively well-structured course material, replacing it with his free-form, tangent-filled lectures, with no useful slides or notes posted. \r\n\r\nLogistics is a nightmare. Completely unreliable and disorganized. Difficult to get in touch with and has yet to timely follow through (if at all) on a single assurance he's made all semester when you do. Hasn't bothered to figure out the most basic software used for the course, making things even worse for students in every way (exams, projects, recordings, notes, slides).\r\n\r\nEven if we end up with an insane curve to make up for his incompetence (which seems to be the case from the first exam), we've been taught little in a potentially fascinating course and have been enormously stressed and frustrated.","1486":"Horrible teacher. He fails at not only teaching but also responding to relevant questions. His lectures are more about his personal life than it is about data science, and I feel like I wasted a lot of time by even attending the lectures. The fact that he had to curve an exam by >30% in a class that's not even meant to be difficult speaks volumes. As much as I'd like to say he's a good person but bad professor, I'm afraid to say an irresponsible professor is not exactly the best person.\r\n\r\nIf you're reading this, kindly teach relevant information. As much as some members of the class enjoy your tangents, I (and many others) came here to learn and nothing else. Please teach in a practical and planned manner. I loathe those who are fortunate enough to not value over 90 minutes of time.\r\n\r\nTo reiterate, if you are reading this: Students come here to learn data science. You are obviously a talented and tested individual, and clearly possess the capability of teaching. I can only assume you think we don't take this course seriously, and therefore neither should you.","1487":"Absolutely horrid professor and class. If you take this class get prepared to teach yourself all the material related to any assignment or quiz. He has no comprehension of what it's like to be a student in his class where he handwaves every topic briefly with no reinforcement and then assigns us projects where it is NOT RELATED AT ALL to what he is teaching. He is more concerned with his job at EBay than he is with actually being a good professor and to compensate for this just showers the class in extra credit (which does not make him a better professor). Overall, horrible professor. If you enjoy learning any actual material don't take a class with him. You will regret it.","1488":"READ! This semester was his first time teaching and he caused a blunder with the midterm, which wasn't even that bad in my opinion. That's the only reason a bunch of nutcases spammed him with 1-star reviews. Anyway, he curved very reasonably and is set on not repeating his mistake. Aside from this, he consistently enlightens us about the Data Science industry and teaches us useful concepts relevant to the industry. His lectures are fun to go to! Additionally, he listens. He's always asking for feedback and genuinely feels bad for the mistakes he has caused. You study for exams (both online) by following a well-written study guide he provides. Regarding projects, they are also fun and you learn applicable Data Science skills. There's no final exam, but instead, a final project where you can make what you want to while fulfilling certain requirements. Max is super lenient with your ideas and is super easy to talk to. If you're uneasy because of his reviews, just go talk to him and decide for yourself.","1489":"Honestly, ignore the 1-star reviews. He has a 5 star on ratemyprofessor out of 30 ratings. It's from UMBC and it's the same Max, I checked his LinkedIn. I can guarantee the 1-star reviewers are all nerds.\r\n\r\nMax is hilarious, makes lectures fun, and teaches valuable course material. People are mad because \"what he says in lecture doesn't help us with the projects\", yea, it doesn't. That is a common occurrence for higher-level CMSC courses. I guess none of those reviewers have gotten past CMSC351\/CMSC330 yet.  Projects involve using code to extract text from websites, organizing it, and making graphs\/visualizations out of the data to make a point. Do people actually expect Max to stand there for 90 minutes every lecture teaching us how to code in pandas? He showed us the basics then everything else builds on that. Making a pretty visualization is something google helps you with. I do think Max should provide us with documents with code examples relevant to the projects outside of lecture, which is something he currently does not do, otherwise I don't mind his teaching.\r\n\r\nMax also uses his experience from working in the field to teach us and explain what is and is not relevant. I love knowing what topics are actually used in the field because I want to work in data science. Knowing what to expect means I can focus on certain topics more and do better on interviews. Everyone that is roasting Max for talking about his work in the field is an absolute donut that just wants to be spoon-fed code instead of learning topics at a high level and figuring out the code on their own. \r\n\r\nMax is also a very considerate and reasonable instructor that understands that students have a life outside of his class and is willing to accommodate for special circumstances. Very down to earth and likable dude","1490":"Yeah anyone who gave him a 5 is a complete lunatic. I'll admit he has promise but for now he is currently teaching one of the worst run CS courses in the entire department. Nice guy, would love to get a beer with him some time but the course is so disorganized to the point where it makes learning horrible. He was adamant on changing the slides in the beginning of the year because they \"weren't good\" and now instead teaches off whatever tangents his brain works off of. I can't imagine how Jose feels as he recently revamped the course just to have it ruined by Max. Maybe once he sorts this all out he'll be better, but for now he deserves the 1, ignore anyone who gave him a 5.","1491":"A pretty unorganized course to be honest, but it's his first semester teaching so it's to be expected. Only problem with this course is that there isn't enough code examples in class and the slides\/notes are unorganized if there are any at all. Other than that, he's a cool guy and completely understanding\/willing to take feedback. The 1-star reviewers are all crybaby's and think everything they need to know for this class needs to be spoon-fed to them like a little child. People even tried to take advantage of his kindness claiming the stat questions on the midterm shouldn't count because STAT400 isn't a prerequisite for this class. Well... if you made it through CMSC250 and can't solve a simple Bayes Equation question then I really don't know what to tell you.","1492":"Sucks. If you want to learn anything avoid him.","1493":"terrible professor. picture this: jose, a very good and well respected professor, teaches this class the previous semester, takes his time to redo the course material, makes all these projects and slides, proper organized class. then max comes along, deletes all the slides, keeps the projects because he is too lazy to create new ones (he literally wont stop talking about how he has never even seen the projects) and whos lectures consist of word vomiting material he only has surface level knowledge on, then has exams that are designed to be googled on. he has amassed a weird bunch of groupies who will shill for whatever he says (hence all the 5 stars who sound like they were written by the same person). Do not take any class with this man","1494":"The worst course I have ever taken! Attending lectures is a total waste of time because you cannot learn anything. You need to teach yourself everything when doing projects and reviewing for exams, and when you are taking the exam you need to google almost everything. If you want to pay a lot of tuition and gain the ability to be a self-learner, take this course with Max. Although Max is a nice professor, who likes talking about his success in the industry, this course is so unorganized and that is because he removed all the good slides from the previous semesters and wants to teach this course in his own way. \r\nThe first exam was a nightmare.  The exam was not related to his lecture and we had no idea about what kinds of problems would be in the exam. He curved a lot to make up for that, but it still can't change the fact that we did not learn ANYTHING.","1495":"AVOID. Not only learn nothing, but also take your time complete projects that are completely unrelated to the course content. Be prepared to spend hours understand the project and google.","1496":"(online fall 2020)\r\n\r\nWas excellent lecturing and responsive to questions while giving proofs and examples for course content. Pace was fine and he was generous with regards to exam scheduling.","1497":"Couse was interesting, Wiseley taught it well and recorded lectures. Homework and exams followed the lectures to a T and were easy enough. Average exam grades were around 90 without a curve, but that might've been because they were open for 48 hours due to online classes so you could rewatch lectures.\r\n\r\nOnly nitpick is I thought it was kind of boring sometimes but that might've just been the fact that the class was online. ","1498":"This is my third time having Nelson as my CS professor (I had him for cmsc131 and cmsc216), and he's growing on me. He makes so many weird\/painful jokes in class which makes it difficult for me to focus, but also keeps me awake so that's good haha.\r\n\r\nCMSC389N was an alright elective. Midterms were easy as hell and the final probably will be too, but there's a ton of written code required. We had a group project where we had to use php\/html, javascript, and bootstrap and that was actually pretty neat and a good group learning experience.\r\n\r\nThis is a great class for anyone looking to get into php\/javascript and web app platforms, or databases. I ended up despising web dev this semester, but it was a good experience to learn some php\/html, JS\/JQuery, and SQL in case I have to use it in the future... plus Nelson is a laugh, haha. Good luck!","1499":"Amazing","1500":"Currently in his 389N class now but this is my third straight spring semester with him as a teacher. Had him two years ago in 132, and last year in 216. So this review will cover all those classes.\r\n\r\n132: First time having a class with him and my god he was crazy funny and just all around cool. People don't like him because of his jokes but he does that because he believes that students can only focus for a short period of time and need to take a small break before focusing on the lecture again. I find this VERY effective! He is a really effective teacher. I got a C in 131, barely survived, and when I took Nelson for 132, I had a whole new understanding of the material that was way more invaluable from studying java the previous semester. First time taking his exams at this time as well and he basically makes his real ones the same flavor as the practice exams (because they're all old exams). Naturally he makes the final harder and a little more different but it can be done. 132 was my favorite semester at UMD and nelson was a HUGE part of it. Made me happy to be a CS Major.\r\n\r\n216: Ok so i had to retake after fucking it up the semester before with Herman. Most of what I said about 132 can be repeated here as well. Old exams follow the same style as the ones he gives you. The projects, yes are daunting and make you stress a little bit but with a little tenacity it can be done. he made 216 a lot easier for me after Herman ruined it for me. \r\n\r\n389N: It's my most favorite class of the semester. Despite the time its taught in the mornings any class with Nelson is a blast and this class is his \"child\" so to speak. It's web dev which is right up my alley and his passion as well. The first exam was really really (and i mean really) easy. And the projects i can finish in a matter of 2-3 days depending on how much time i spend on them. Unless Nelson offers more classes or teaches more in the upper levels this will most likely be my last semester with him as a teacher :( It was well worth it all three times. He makes you proud to be a CS major.","1501":"He's a very funny professor who actually provides a good CS course. His projects are very reasonable, and he even gives code example to help with the projects. Tests are very easy, you just have to practice his old exams that he provides. I never got lower than a B- taking 3 of his classes. CMSC131, CMSC132, CMSC389N.","1502":"This guy is basically your favorite high school teacher as a UMD professor.\r\n\r\nReally, really good dude.  If you ever have any problems while you're taking his class, you can go to his office hours and talk to him about it and he will do his best to work through those issues with you.  He seriously, legitimately, actually cares about his students, which is something you don't see very often.\r\n\r\nAs much as I'm tempted to give him a 5 star review, I can't just because he's not a great lecturer.  He's funny in class, but he gets a little off-topic and distracted a lot, so a lot of what you learn from him, you have to learn from his slides outside of class.  He makes this super easy though, because his slides are great and he records all his lectures on panopto, so you can go back over things if you missed something.\r\n\r\nAll in all, he's one of my favorite professors I've had here and if you get a chance to take a class with him, do it.  You won't be disappointed as long as you actually take the time to talk to him and get to know him.","1503":"Really nice guy, class can be bit boring at times. Exams are just like past exams so study them","1504":"Very smart","1505":"yoon dropped php and made this a javascript\/react\/mongo class. exam averages were 50% every time, with good curve (5-8%?) at end. around last half of semester <20 out of 110 kids attended lectures. Mostly a self taught class","1506":"I was dazzled by his ability to teach. Other TAs should look up to him as a pillar of hope.","1507":"Good professor. Class is ridiculously easy though.","1508":"Hard exams, but the content is extremely worthwhile when you get a job.","1509":"Don't ever take this class with this professor. On exams there's just a lot of problems that are impossible to complete in the given time limit, averages were about 50% for every exam. Barely curved and overall felt like he wasn't effective in getting the important points across. If you want to take this course wait til a different semester when there is another professor, that's what I wish I did.","1510":"The online version of this class is not easy. Exams are long and very detailed, so Yoon definitely expects you to go over all minor concepts and code snippets before you take an exam. Midterm and final average was around 55%. However, the workload is not bad, and I think everyone was given fair amount of time to complete each project. Yoon applied a roughly 6% curve at the end, according to the statistical information of class. The teaching quality is pretty average. Overall, if you have to take this class, arrange this class taught by Yoon to one of your light-weight semesters, and you will be doing just fine.","1511":"I had Professor Gonzalez for CMSC389N and he was really nice. He was very accommodating and always willing to help. The content in the course is not very difficult but could sometimes be a little boring. Overall, I would recommend CMSC389N for those who are looking for a computer science elective.","1512":"Krishan was always a great TA and I learned a lot about web development. I learned how to code very well. I am now a pro coder.","1513":"I just want to say this dude is one of the worst professors at UMD. even worse than kruskal or teli or whoever else you want to name. I mean how do you turn a course about Javascript into having similar exam averages to cmsc351? That's absurd and complete blasphemy. You want to learn JS then just learn from w2schools. Don't take 389N expecting it to be an easy elective because it's not if you are taking it with Yoon. I also had him for 131 before which was a better experience but honestly that's the only class he should ever be teaching since 131 is a weedout course.","1514":"Really chill professor, goes over material really well. Open to questions and highly encourages students to participate in class. Projects are chill for the most part, the midterm was pretty hard but the final was much easier. Highly recommend 389N with Andrej. ","1515":"This class is very different from a regular computer science course. Many of intended requirements and documentation for the class is not explicitly written, and you have to watch videos in order to understand what your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is even supposed to do. If you enjoy having explicit criteria for how your projects are supposed to function and do not like to have to watch a poorly made and slow video many times in order to understand the projects, I would avoid this class. On top of having to watch such unorganized criteria for such videos, his written documentation for projects are not very helpful either and lack critical information and details. It is obvious that little effort is made into writing the project descriptions. His lecture slides are not very organized and do not go into proper detail of the course content, so I find myself google everything for the class. I did not attend very many lectures, but his recordings had low audio quality and he rambles quite a lot. His examples are needlessly hard, and loves to go into random edge case quirks of the language that are almost never actually used or even considered in practice. I took this class thinking it would be an easy CS class, but the lack of structure and direction made me wish I was retaking 351 again.","1516":"Reasons to take CMSC389N:\r\n- Introduction to the frontend world\r\n\r\n- Yoon is a very nice person\r\n\r\n- Yoon and his course staff are super responsive on Piazza and email\r\n\r\nReasons to not take CMSC389N:\r\n- Lectures are basically Yoon trying to rush through an endless number of examples that are more complicated and lengthier than what they need to be. \r\n\r\n- Oftentimes, the goal of the class isn't solely your learning. Yoon allows cheatsheets on exams, and when we encountered a hard question\/ example, he simply suggested that we should put an example of the case on our cheatsheets. \r\n\r\n- A countless number of times, you will find yourself memorizing code without knowing what exactly the functionality of the code is. As CS students at UMD, we all know that an effective developer must read the documentation. However, I am not paying tuition to just read the documentation\r\n\r\n- Yoon spends countless hours going over syntax and corners of Javascript and then ends up rushing through Express, MongoDB, and React which are mostly the things that people actually want to take away from the class.  \r\n\r\n- Yoon sometimes doesn't communicate points clearly and I found myself trying to decrypt his approach\r\n\r\n- Project descriptions are unclear most of the times\r\n\r\n- Exams are really lengthy and you often have to move on if you don't know the answer right away","1517":"I have to agree with the other review on 12\/03\/2021. Yoon is cool but the exams were unnecessarily difficult while the projects took less than a few hours to complete. The last few weeks cover mongo, react, express etc but it felt like the first month alone was on HTML. \r\n\r\nAlso I was hoping for a php section but it wasn't included despite the course name being \"php and javascript\"","1518":"The projects are easy, the exams are pointless because they do not focus on the essential skills of web development, mostly nit picking little details of javascript","1519":"Why the low rating?\r\n\r\nClass content is pretty interesting if your into web design. The slides in class and relevant documentation is really all you need to succeed in this class since all of the topics are are well established. So naturally I didn't attend lecture. \r\n\r\nThe projects are pretty easy if not repetitive. \r\n\r\nI do have a small problem with the tests in this class. They rely way to heavy on memorizing css properties, which i think is pretty useless when i can just have a list of css properties open while i code. \r\n\r\nAlso we didn't have React covered by class projects, but ended up being a big part of the final exam. which was pretty annoying since i had no experience with React. He did give a pretty solid curve though so no harm really done with those lost points.","1520":"Fawzi is a great guy. Really nice and respectful to students and he understands students very well. He is very funny too and an interesting teacher. He will often start the class saying \"What the hell am I doing right now?\" or something like that because he will chat with students almost to the point that he forgets he has to teach. But don't worry, you will always get through all the material for the day and you will understand it well enough. Biggest recommendation: start the projects early. You will be amazed at how good you feel and the stuff you can do when you've already finished your CS project early.","1521":"Great professor, awesome person.\n\r\nIf computer science is not your thing, this is the best professor you can have. He explains every concept thoroughly and tests you only on what he goes over in class. I'd highly recommend going to class because if you don't, the powerpoint slides will seem really disjointed and incoherent, but in class he explains everything.\r\nProjects are extremely reasonable and are very relevant to what you're doing in class. Quizzes mimic the worksheets he gives out. If you have a problem in the class, USE YOUR RESOURCES (professor, TAs) because they can immensely help.\r\nMakes some funny jokes that lighten the mood of his class, creating a very comfortable environment.\n\r\nThe only complaint is that the end of the semester is pretty rushed in terms of material. He goes over many design patterns, sorting techniques, and algorithm strategies very quickly, and you're expected to have a basic understanding of ALL of them on the final exam. ","1522":"Pretty easy class. Projects could get a bit tricky, but tests and quizzes were not a problem at all. Starting the projects early and getting them out of the way is a good idea.\n\r\nNelson was encouraging and helpful the few times I have approached him outside of class. As a teacher, he did a pretty good job explaining concepts. No complaints here.","1523":"Best professor in the department, in terms of balancing knowledgability, skill of teaching, and inspiration he provides to students to go out and learn things for themselves.  I had a slightly rough semester (in terms of workload), but managed to learn a lot from him.  Skips around a lot, beginning of class is devoted to announcements and sidenotes (he shows a lot of XKCDs, HacDC, and other topics related to the subject, but outside the scope of class, which sometimes takes up most of the class), we were one of the few classes who actually explored threading a bit more in-depth than others.  3 projects every semester are devoted to going out on your own, picking a project you want to do, and doing it.  It should be \"something cool\", \"something cooler\", and \"something coolest\" respectively.\n\r\nGo to his office hours not just for questions on projects, but just for general interest in the subject.  Get to know the guy.  He may be helpful in the future, in terms of internships and jobs (had many stints with Google and other major companies)","1524":"Overall the honors version of this class is good to take because of the small class size and the opportunity to get help on projects from the professor.  Pugh was a pretty good teacher, and was very knowledgeable of all the material.  Sometimes I felt like he skipped around to different topics not in the curriculum, or he would expect us to know certain things without having spent time on them in class.  I also got frustrated on some of the projects because it seemed like we hadn't learned enough to do them, but in the end this helped me learn better.  He would provide more information about the projects as they got closer to the deadlines and would provide ample time in class to work on them\/ask questions.  Id say take this class over the regular version.","1525":"Pros: The curriculum is fair, he provides some really great tools for motivation with stuff you can do outside of class, and he's got great experience. Also, he really takes the time to know and help his students. If you approach him with a question, be it class-oriented or about computer science in general, he'll go into great detail and make sure he answers your question despite how long it might take.\n\r\nCons: This is probably a personal thing, but he he didn't teach with slides which might work for a lot of people, but I feel like after glazing over the information in lecture, I learned more from slides from different sections. Overall, this class is still worth taking.","1526":"He's an interesting guy, and a pretty good professor. He allows laptops in class and mainly teaches by example and not powerpoint, which prevents class from becoming a slog. Only potential downside is that he assigns more projects and at a faster interval. If you are truly interested in programming and becoming better at it, Pugh is a good cs132 professor, but if you didn't do so great in 131 and are just scraping by, look for someone else.","1527":"though he did stray in content a fair bit from what the course description was, it ended up making the class more interesting.\r\nThe semester that I had him (Fall 09), he had three times throughout the semester in which you had the freedom to pick your own project topic and learn a lot outside of class on something that interested you. That being said, don't take him if you aren't motivated enough to work on and learn rigorous individualized material on your own.Also, he put up several of his personal books as prizes for the writers of the best projects.\r\nAlso, he had an interesting policy that apart from regular lecture time, there were optional subgroups that students could choose to join.\r\nHis choice not to focus on the somewhat dull material covered by the 132 course ended up making the course a lot more interesting and provided honors students with an opportunity for quasi-independent work at times.  In general, he was incredibly flexible to class desires in how he would run his class.","1528":"Pugh is a really interesting professor, and really knows his stuff when it comes to Java (he wrote part of the language spec). He is a pretty good teacher, though in the honors section we would often times digress from curriculum to talk about other things - which meant learning some things on your own.","1529":"He's a little idiosyncratic, but his class is fairly easy to understand, and he answers questions well (for the most part).  Nelson is the main professor for CMSC132, so there isn't much Tseng can do with regards to exams, etc.","1530":"Purtilo is a solid professor who respects his students. He is an efficient teacher, and he frequently ended class early, since we tended to get ahead of the other sections. He makes it clear that he is dedicated to producing \"satisfied customers\" of his students.","1531":"DO NOT TAKE HIM FOR CMSC132 OR ANY INTRO-LEVEL CLASS......FOR AN UPPER LEVEL COURSE HE HAS NO EQUAL. Just so we are clear. \n\r\nDr. Purtilo is a phenomenal professor, engaging lecturer, and an all-around wonderful person. However, he is simply not interested in teaching lower level classes. He instead will lecture on far more upper-level topics of overall software engineering and product development which, while very interesting, have little to do with the course material. He will occasionally go through the syllabus but blow through it at a staggering speed so no one can not learn any of it.\n\r\nIn our class he did \"show and tell\" Fridays where he brought in ancient relics of computer engineering and explained their functions, inner workings, and how modern design has since expanded. For one interested in such a subject this experience is phenomenal, but anyone taking the course simply to learn Java would roll their eyes.\n\r\n If you enroll in his class you will want to attend every lecture out of interest, however, will have to pray that another professor posts their lecture slides and that your TA knows how to actually code in Java (or read the textbook I suppose...gasp!). My course took a significant amount of outside-lecture work.\n\r\nHe has long left Java in his profession so any syntax question on its inner workings (you know, the entire midterm and final test material) he will do his best to answer for you and certainly take time outside of class to be sure he gets you the right answer. But this whole process could have been avoided by simply taking a professor more focused on lower-level programming.\n\r\nIf you are competent learning material outside of lecture and are genuinely interested in computer science his knowledge, persona, and class complete a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to learn material beyond the textbook from a truly remarkable person. BUT If you are taking a lower level class to satisfy some random requirement his class will require a lot of unnecessary work.","1532":"Great professor. Funny and covers the material well.
